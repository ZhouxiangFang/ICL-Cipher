Ġsecond,Ġwork,"Input:Being new to epilators I bought one and was underwhelmed, so I thought I'd try a few more and see if I could get any improvement. Enter the Braun Silk Epi, which is very highly rated so I thought I'd give it a try. At first I thought it was amazing, less pain than the first one I tried, but I noticed the fine hairs weren't actually being plucked, they were just shorter. Great, that's not what I'm going for here. Not to mention the fact that there's only the epilator head, and the brush head. There aren't even any guards to make the epilator head smaller if I wanted to pluck less hairs at once, even thought the pictures CLEARLY show that there are guards for this epilator. I went over the same sections over and over again, and frequently nothing seemed to happen. I adjusted the pressure I was using, the speed, everything. I'm pretty sure this is just breaking hairs off as opposed to actually doing anything. I also couldn't find any of the hairs that it was supposedly plucking. With my other epilator I would frequently stop and clean it out because the roots were getting stuck to the guard because hair roots are sticky (for lack of a better word), with this one there was never any evidence of plucked hairs sticking, which leads me to believe it was only ever breaking the hair off as opposed to pulling it out by the root. The brush is nice, ergo the second star, but if you want the brush you might as well just pick up a separate brush and a different epilator. Oh, and forget about trying to epilate your arm pits, I tried every direction and went over the areas over, and over to little effect. I finally went back over the areas with my old epilator.
Output:negative
Input:I loved this smell the second I sprayed it.  I’ve gotten a few more friends to buy it as well!
Output:positive
Input:This lasted me only two trips. On the last trip it ripped where you can hang it and the pouches ripped open. It is a very low quality.  Love the look and all it holds but it doesn't roll nicely the second anything is put in it is wont close.
Output:negative
Input:Used it twice it was hard to fold after the second use it would not stand up and it wouldn’t fold any more got a refund couldn’t send it back because it wouldn’t fold
Output:negative
Input:Ripped the second time I used it.
Output:negative
Input:I have gotten 2 of these now and each time it breaks one way or another. The first time the shaving piece broke off after 1 use. This second time used a few more times and now other pieces are breaking off. For having to keep getting new ones I would not have spent so much on it. The only nice part is the battery lasts a decent amount of time.
Output:negative
Input:It worked as expected. The designs nice and simple and easy to use. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because you have to turn the heat all the way up to get it fully melted. It’s still a little thick at the second highest level. But for the price I think it’s great and it did what it was supposed to do.
Output:positive
Input:This is my second purchase from this seller. The first product I ordered I loved it a lot: It's quite invisible, thin, perfect to human color, and it doesn't feel thick when wearing it so I order 2 this time. However, this time they sent me 2 totally different type, different color one. One is very white and thick and feel quite sharp when it pushes up the skin because of its thickness. It looks totally a disaster on the eyelid.<br /><br />The second one, its color is a bit darker than the older one I bought before from the same seller, but the quality is the same: Thin, color is almost invisible, and feel so comfy. I want to give this seller 3 stars but I changed my mind, only 2 stars for sending me a bad one :)
Output:negative
Input:I am on my second day of using this product. I have used other products - some work, some do nothing. I am hoping for the former on this. It has a very thin applicator brush so you can just line the upper part of your eyelashes and when dry, you can apply mascara. I haven't had any adverse reactions. I will know more as time goes on. It looks like my lashes are darker already, but that could be my wishful thinking.
Output:positive
Input:I have tried other organic brands of argan oil and I don't find this to be inferior in any way. It actually smells more nutty. I love the smell. Leaves my skin and hair well conditioned and it comes at a very reasonable price. I have become very weary about chemicals in all the cosmetic products we use and was looking for a natural substitute of body milk. Savannah's argan oil works great for this purpose. I also put it on my hair which is very dry. It keeps it conditioned and decreases the frizz. I just bought my second bottle of Savannah's and am planning to continue buying it if it remains at this excellent price.
Output:positive
Input:The concept is great, but the product design is flawed. First smaller rubber ring ripped second time I used it.  Waste of money
Output:negative
Input:The first use was great - went on smooth and stayed on for many hours.  The second time I used it, it came off in chunks and left big waxy pieces all over my lips.  I trashed it after that.
Output:negative
Input:This is the second time I've purchased this item. This one was a smaller size for unknown reasons. I contacted but received NO response.
Output:negative
Input:I really wanted this stuff to work!  Unfortunately, all it did was make me feel wetter, which I didn't have a problem with in the first place.  So, in fact, it actually felt looser rather than tighter because, due to the wetness, we lost what little friction we had without the product.<br />  The first time I tried this, I applied it about 10 minutes prior to intercourse.  The second time, I made sure I was really dry inside first (just wiped with toilet paper), and then applied, waited 10 minutes, applied again, and waited another 10 minutes, then approached hubby.  I thought maybe increased amount over longer period of time would help give the product time to work.  But, yet again, it did nothing for me.<br />  I've had 4 vaginal deliveries of babies about 7.5 lbs, so maybe that plays a role.  I am very sad because I had high hopes for what this product might be able to do.  I guess some sort of surgery (that I can't afford) is my only hope of my husband and I having a good sex life again.
Output:negative
Input:I opened immediately when I received the package, and I’m in love with it! Julia works perfectly well, it releases a good amount of steam and I’m amazed with the way Julia can move around the steam to easily access other areas of the room. The only thing is that the material is not as I expected, it seems to be plastic but at least it’s very light! Overall, this is a great diffuser.<br /><br />UPDATE: On the second day using it, I’ve realised it DOES NOT work for up to 18hours continuously, if even 6 hours. The diffuser doesn’t diffuse the whole water content inside it and always stops a bit before it’s over. Also, the function that lets it release steam moving in the room is not working anymore, as it stops in a particular side and seems to have trouble moving to the other side. I expected more from such an expensive diffuser

Input:My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.<br /><br />1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.<br /><br />I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.

Input:This was not my first time using a jelly mask and I followed mixing instructions as usual, so I have no clue why the mask ended up as it did. I put everything that was in the bowl onto my face...was going to wait the minimum 20 minutes before removing, however, the mask was already a dried, powdery clay-looking mess before the time was up. There was no peeling off, and I was barely able to rinse it off...was very hard, and looked like I was taking paint chips off my face! I used the lemon mask, which was the only one that was a whitening mask...I wonder though, since it definitely isn't going to whiten after just one mask, do I have to keep buying this set just to get the lemon one? Doesn't seem worth it. On the bright side, it did make my face feel soft after the irritation and annoyance of removing the mask...but, I can get the same results elsewhere, so definitely won't order again!

Doesn't stay on as long as I hoped a Parfum Spray would. I would definitely  buy again, but it is pricey!!. The other Chanel cologne/parfums I like are Chance and Coco. This one is my favorite.

Input:Unless your going to wear for 1 day PLEASE DONT BUY!!! Looks great out the package but horrible once on your head. I wanted to then for the holiday to put it, when I brushed it stands of hair began to come out from the root. I put water in it and it began to tangle and mat up. Worst wig ever!! I don’t usually write reviews but I was so disappointed with the wig that I had too. It’s not worth the money, it’s a must return!!

Input:Let me just say this, the moment I removed it from the pack I was completely in LOVE with this hair!!! I ordered the 22 20 and 18 inch bundles but they appear WAYYY longer than that!! I am 5’6 and putting the hair up to my perimeter it comes down to my waist!! The wefts on the bundles themselves are SUPER thick, I doubt u will need all 3 to achieve a full lustrous look. The hair is nice and thick from weft to end and it is very silky and soft🔥 I haven’t installed yet as I am waiting for my HD Closure to come in, so with that said I will then 2 weeks after my install tomorrow and will come back with an update!!!

Input:I've spent way too much money trying to find a good deodorant without aluminum ever since I noticed that antiperspirants were causing my armpits to darken.  This is the only one I've found that not only has a nice, fresh scent, but also lasts all day.  It takes a long time to deliver but it's 100% worth the then.

Input:After waiting over a month for this to arrive, it broke with the first wearing. It did not look like the one in the photo:  it had only one whimpy feather on each end and one of them broke off the first time it was worn.

Input:This was not my first time using a jelly mask and I followed mixing instructions as usual, so I have no clue why the mask ended up as it did. I put everything that was in the bowl onto my face...was going to then the minimum 20 minutes before removing, however, the mask was already a dried, powdery clay-looking mess before the time was up. There was no peeling off, and I was barely able to rinse it off...was very hard, and looked like I was taking paint chips off my face! I used the lemon mask, which was the only one that was a whitening mask...I wonder though, since it definitely isn't going to whiten after just one mask, do I have to keep buying this set just to get the lemon one? Doesn't seem worth it. On the bright side, it did make my face feel soft after the irritation and annoyance of removing the mask...but, I can get the same results elsewhere, so definitely won't order again!

Input:For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave. Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.

Input:Finally! After trying to order a working, undamaged, clean, unused, decent set of these atomizers, here's something that fits the bill! I've tried a few other sets out there. They all look exactly the same as these. But those never once arrived in a decent condition. They were just thrown in thin plastic bags, as they are, no protection of any kind. No packaging. Just... atomizers. Naked. In a plastic shipping bag. Often looking like someone's returns, too. Of course they all arrived dented, scratched, falling apart, mismatched colors and what not. Ridiculous. And disgusting. These were actually packed in an adequate box that protects them! Yaaay! They arrived protected, safely tucked and packed, and all in proper working condition and without a scratch. And they are beautiful, too! The ones I've tried so far work like a charm. They seem to be well made. The spray is a nice fine mist. No leaking. And they are so handy to take with you wherever. The size is nice, too. Just what I was looking for.

The little nail clipper that comes with the kit are really great also, they trim nails quickly and effortlessly. The way they open and close are very unique. They close very compactly for carrying.

Input:This product is good while it lasts; it'll clean your teeth better than almost anything out there (unless you have tartar, then you'll need something with a bit more power) and stimulate your gums.  However, having autopsied this model, I am convinced that it was engineered to fail under typical conditions after a time, perhaps to motivate the purchase of a more expensive model, which will itself become useless when the irreplaceable batteries go out.<br /><br />The first one I bought lasted a year, and even that long only after I learned that you have to plug the two holes in the back of the battery compartment to prevent the corrosion from taking place.  By the end, batteries were lasting one week tops, at 2x use per day.  I also learned that you have to hit it against hard objects when it won't turn on and sometimes then it'll go.  You also need to scrape off any rust from the battery contacts occasionally.<br /><br />Knowing these quirks, I bought another one and immediately plugged up the holes in the back and put tape around the battery cap.  However, it has now lasted only a month.  There's no rust or corrosion to speak of, however, it just doesn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />Today I autopsied the first sonicare to see why it had failed (the new one is still on warranty).  In taking it apart, it's clear that most of your money goes into buying a tank-like shell around the $1 worth of electronics.  This would be a good thing, if there were not two gaping holes in the battery cap that let water in anyway and the shoddy rubber seal.  After taking it apart, it's clear why the corrosion so quickly leads the failure.  They protect everything on the circuit-board from corrosion by putting glue over it, except the battery contacts, and the contacts and wires that lead to the solenoid coil (that makes the brush vibrate).  The contacts that lead to the solenoid and the battery contacts are also strategically located next to each other on the circuit board, so they can corrode together quickly using any moisture from the adjacent battery-terminal holes, while the non-essentials like the timer are located on the other side of the board and completely sealed off from the ambient air by glue.  This also explains why hitting it sometimes allows it to start; you're shaking some of the corrosion loose.<br /><br />The switch is also of questionable design, being nothing more than a paper-thin piece of plastic with some kind ring on it that's slightly more conductive than the plastic.<br /><br />If the replacement that I get out of the warranty fails, I think I'll try a cybersonic or an oral-b; hopefully their teams of engineers weren't paid to make something less reliable than a politician.<br /><br />Why can't they make a sonic toothbrush with no batteries, that plugs into the wall, and lasts a lifetime?  Or just quit making these to fail so readily?

If you use kiss glue - I prefer the kind you can brush on like nail polish - these last for 2 weeks. Make sure your nails are dry, do not wash hands or shower for 8 hours after application (best to do at night before bed), & do a handful of scuffs with a nail file on top of the nail before applying (that gives it texture - really makes a difference).

Input:The wig fits great, on both me (29 yrs old) and my 9 yr old daughter, with the adjustable clips. Looks very pretty on, and the braid is nice and long, to about my elbow. Also, the quality of the wig hair is nice. I have many wigs, and have purchased some that have this terrible cheap 'sheen' look to them, which i can't stand- and this wig is not like that at all- gorgeous color and finish to the hair strands!  Just be aware that at the front middle of the forhead, the wig is shaped in a 'widows peak'. This is how Elsa's hair looks in the cartoon- and at first i was kind of surprised by the look, but then i realized it did look good and i am definitely happy with the wig. Also, the snowflake clips are beautiful! they add the perfect extra touch!

And voila - Beautiful, long nails!

Input:The wig fits great, on both me (29 yrs old) and my 9 yr old daughter, with the adjustable clips. Looks very pretty on, and the braid is nice and long, to about my elbow. Also, the quality of the wig hair is nice. I have many wigs, and have purchased some that have this terrible cheap'sheen' look to them, which i can't stand- and this wig is not like that at all- gorgeous color and finish to the hair strands!  Just be aware that at the front middle of the forhead, the wig is shaped in a 'widows peak'. This is how Elsa's hair looks in the cartoon- and at first i was instructions of surprised by the look, but then i realized it did look good and i am definitely happy with the wig. Also, the snowflake clips are beautiful! they add the perfect extra touch!

Input:I like this coffee scrub! The ingredients are simple, yet powerful. It smells like a good, spiced coffee dessert with the cinnamon and ginger. As with any coffee scrub, you have to use this consistently to see any instructions of results. I find that this improves my skin softness and shaving is a dream after I use this scrub. Overall a great scrub!

There is not a lot of hair, but that is my preference.  If you match it to your bio hair, it should look completely natural.  My only issue is I cannot figure out a good color for me.

These magic foam sponge donut maker comes in 2 smalls and 2 large. The wire inside the sponges make it possible in making a donut shape out of your hair. It is very easy and quick to use that will give you a classy look in no time at all. There is also no need for bobby pins and other helping tools to secure your hair and maintain the style through the day. All you have to do is tie up your hair then place your hair inside the cut of the sponge and pull it down until you reach the last quarter of your hair. Roll the sponge until you reach the top of your hair and bend the sponge until each ends meet and the bun is secure.Move your hair a little bit just to cover the sponge and you’re done. In my opinion, this is easier to use than the donut bun maker that I saw. You do not need a practice just to use this and achieve a hair bun though the sponge itself needs a little improvement. I think the wire needs to be more stronger and the sponge material needs to be more sturdier hence my four star. You need to be more careful in pulling out the sponge coz you might tear it but other than that the bun works good for me.

Input:Needless to say i have xp with hair removal.  I was never really a super hairy but loved the feeling of being totally hairless from head to toe.<br /><br />With all the sessions and hrs i barley have any hair but do have some spots on thighs, arms and other spots, that are fairly light even with all the professional laser treatments and electrolysis.  IPL aka this device is NOT the go-to treatment for hair reduction but it does work.<br /><br />Firstly, you need to use an electric razor or standard razor on the areas your zapping.  Freshly showered, no oils or lotions on skin.  If you dont feel heat your not killing hair follicles.  The laser targets the pigment in the hair and absorbs the heat, so as they stated vampire skin, dark hair gets the best results.<br /><br />If you have never gotten any sort of  pro hair removal your hair is going to be fuller and courser.  Like the subject heading states, ive had 28 full body laser hair removal treatments aka real hair removal that leaves you with red bumps, plus hrs of electrolysis and I still have hair grow back.<br /><br />People it takes a long time to remove hair!  This is not designed to be a one zap and the hair is gone.  It will grow back finer and weaker, until it eventually is killed off.  It literally takes years.<br /><br />I zap each spot 5 times on the highest setting.  The heat will build on each subsequent zap, meaning im actually hitting follicles.  I would not recommend this if you have course hair or never had pro hair removal - build up to that, but this device is a nice supplement to the pro hair removal.  It will never replace it and will take longer. For me its perfect and thats why i gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />Once you zap the hair you should see a reaction, raised bumps, some redness, along the bikini line for example its very noticeable since the hair is courser - that means its working.  It takes about 10 -14 days for the zapped hair to push its way out.  Its not instant, the hair still remains in the follicle.  You can expedite this by lightly exfoliating in the bath or shower.  You may see little black spots in the follicle where the hair has been zapped and effectively targeted.<br /><br />Hair grows in cycles, doing this every week is pointless, if the hair is not in the growth phase you cant kill it. Every 4 weeks, multiple zaps per spot and the hair WILL fall out and come back weaker.  Different areas have different growth cycles but 4 weeks is a good middle ground.<br /><br />  This is used for hair reduction.  If you want permanent (still takes multiple treatments( you need electrolysis.<br /><br />If you want faster hair reduction result you need to use laser only found at the dermatologist or reputable laser spa.  IPL is not laser treatment. This is not going to ever replace that.  A combination of all three over 3 or 4  years will leave you hairless, so keep your expectations realistic.

This is not designed to be a one zap and the hair is gone.  It will grow back finer and weaker, until it eventually is killed off.  It literally takes years.<br /><br />I zap each spot 5 times on the highest setting.  The heat will build on each subsequent zap, meaning im actually hitting follicles.  I would not recommend this if you have course hair or never had pro hair removal - build up to that, but this device is a nice supplement to the pro hair removal.  It will never replace it and will take longer. For me its perfect and thats why i gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />Once you zap the hair you should see a reaction, raised bumps, some redness, along the bikini line for example its very noticeable since the hair is courser - that means its working.  It takes about 10 -14 days for the zapped hair to push its way out.  Its not instant, the hair still remains in the follicle.  You can expedite this by lightly exfoliating in the bath or shower.  You may see little black spots in the follicle where the hair has been zapped and effectively targeted.<br /><br />Hair grows in cycles, doing this every week is pointless, if the hair is not in the growth phase you cant kill it. Every 4 weeks, multiple zaps per spot and the hair WILL fall out and come back weaker.  Different areas have different growth cycles but 4 weeks is a good middle ground.<br /><br />  This is used for hair reduction.  If you want permanent (still takes multiple treatments( you need electrolysis.<br /><br />If you want faster hair reduction result you need to use laser only found at the dermatologist or reputable laser spa.  IPL is not laser treatment. This is not going to ever replace that.  A combination of all three over 3 or 4  years will leave you hairless, so keep your expectations realistic.

Input:I am very pleased so far with the InterSight Naturals Hyaluronic Acid so far. It comes in a 1 oz bottle but a little goes a long way. I will explain in my review.<br /><br />There are a lot of benefits in general to your body with Hyaluronic Acid, including your skin and face. The major benefit is that it is an anti-aging agent. We already have this in our skin. As we age, we lose some along with collagen. Hyaluronic Acid in this Serum allows your skin to retain more moisture, whether you have oily skin or not. It has a lightweight texture and works for oily or dry skin and sensitive skin too. That's great because I personally have all of that going on with my face.<br /><br />There are other serums out there similar to this. I like InterSight's Hyaluronic Acid because it is free of fragrance/scent and drying agents like alcohol. It's ingredients include (of course) hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, green tea, jojoba oil, vitamins c and e and aloe. So, if you are familiar with any of these you will know that these are elements are soothing to the skin and each have their own benefits. I like products that have natural ingredients versus a lot of chemicals that I don't know how to pronounce.<br /><br />This product is advertised to activate collagen production, which is what the h. acid does. It goes beneath the skin's surface when applied correctly and retains moisture, plumping it up like youthful skin. When I use this, I notice that my skin appearance is very youthful and fresh. You can use your own moisturizer afterwards (I switch it up personally but mainly use Vanicream Light Lotion, not cream, because it's &#34;Dye free, perfume/fragrance free, lanolin free, paraben free, formaldehyde free.&#34; Also, it isn't greasy.)<br /><br />This bottle comes with a dropper in it. I have a few tips if it will help anyone for use.<br /><br />1. The product directions are teeny tiny but it says to wash and dry your face, neck and décolletage area first.<br />2. Apply the product. I found that it's easier and less waste to put three drops on my left 3 finger pads - ring, middle and pointer finger, share some with the same fingers on the right hand and apply with an upward direction starting with the décolletage and neck area.<br />*Note - a little goes a long way. I used less than half a dropperful for 1 treatment.<br />*The drops I put on my left finger pads initially are maybe the circumference of or slightly less than a notebook paper hole that is punched out.<br />*Don't put any in your eye socket including eyebrows.<br />*Get close to your hairline but not in it, especially if you color your hair or are hiding gray hairs. Washing your hairline and putting products like this on it will fade the color quicker, at least when you are trying to cover up random stray gray or white hairs.<br />3. Let the product dry before adding moisturizer and then makeup (if any). It doesn't take too long. If you are really in a rush, I have a tip. I keep the mini, battery operated personal fans around for facial stuff. It will help it dry faster.<br />4. Personal tip - Use a moisturizer with SPF 30 or greater during the day when using this (and when not using it too!) I use Elta MD UV Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 45, the transparent version for a lot of reasons. Product is great, non-greasy, soaks in, is for the face and body, cost is reasonable, no scent and it protects my skin! I want to share this because I love products but have some I stick because of how affective it is.<br /><br />This product is not sticky, greasy, and leaves zero residue on your hands, but I recommend washing them anyhow afterwards. Who knows if you may rub your eye, etc.<br /><br />One last tip in case you don't know why you should use it on your décolletage, neck in addition to the face. Guess where aging shows the most? The neck and, not listed prior, your hands! Neck wise-look at people and their necks. The age usually shows up sooner. So, it's important to include it. I include those areas when getting facial peels too - glycolic or salicylic acid - in the fall and winter only. When you put sunscreen on, consider putting it on your hands too, or for that matter, your arms, especially the side that faces the window when you ride in a car.<br /><br />I hope this helps. I have tried different hyaluronic products and really like this one for previous reasons - no scent, a little goes a long way, natural ingredients, leaves  my skin very smooth and doesn't irritate at all plus all the benefits of it.<br /><br />I did receive a discount for this product, but am not obligated in any way to give it a good review. This is totally my opinion based on my using the product as well as my experience with other products. I am very happy with it and plan on buying another retail on Amazon when this one runs out, whenever that is! Thanks for reading my review and please, please use sunscreen if you decide to purchase and use this product!

Input:This is the first korean product that has made me break out and I have very resistant skin. Like I've never broken out from any product or medication! But after using it a couple of times it doesn't irritate my skin anymore. The biggest problem I have with this product is the scent. Honestly, it's like someone threw a bottle of perfume. It is too strong. Also the residue is too gel-like for me. I have used other sleeping masks before but this one doesn't even hydrate my skin enough. There are better and more affordable options out there! Nature Republic has better products than this. Don't bother wasting your money on it. Since I can't return it, I've been using it for my knees and it still doesn't keep my skin moisturized long enough even though my skin isn't too dry!

Input:I have used so many cleansing oil/balm products, but this is hands down the best one I’ve used.<br /><br />Sure, balms are a little extra effort to scoop out than a quick pump oil cleanser, but the quality of ingredients paired with effectiveness of cleansing is totally worth it!<br /><br />I have super sensitive(acne-prone), dry/dehydrated, aging skin and this has not given me any negative reactions...of course, you need to follow up with a water based cleanser for your second step, but after the balm emulsifies - it washes away so beautifully with no sticky/dry texture whatsoever<br /><br />Washes off all my makeup- including heavy eye makeup/lip stains and my 50+ SPF<br /><br />The price is lower than any sold at Sephora/Ulta/etc and the ingredients quality is much better as well- I will never stop purchasing this product! PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE OR I MIGHT DIE ;)

Input:I'm not a makeup diva but I do play with eye makeup quite a bit. When it comes to mascara, I usually alternate between Mabeline and Cover Girl products, but I also dabble in false lashes. This is probably the best mascara I've tried so far. No pics I took do it justice.<br /><br />In terms of appearance, it really did a beautiful job of catching each lash and providing length and fullness, but somehow in a very natural way. It didn't look like I was wearing mascara at all- just like I had fuller natural lashes. I had no issues with clumps and it lasts throughout a full day/ night without any issues. It's actually the only one I know of that washes off cleanly too. Normally, I wind up having to use makeup remover and wind up scrubbing away racoon eyes when I take mine off. This rinsed away in the shower without issue.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'll be getting more when this runs out.

But after using it a couple of times it doesn't irritate my skin anymore. The biggest problem I have with this product is the scent. Honestly, it's like someone threw a bottle of perfume. It is too strong. Also the residue is too gel-like for me. I have used other sleeping masks before but this one doesn't even hydrate my skin enough. There are better and more affordable options out there! Nature Republic has better glue than this. Don't bother wasting your money on it. Since I can't return it, I've been using it for my knees and it still doesn't keep my skin moisturized long enough even though my skin isn't too dry!

Input:I have used so many cleansing oil/balm products, but this is hands down the best one I’ve used.<br /><br />Sure, balms are a little extra effort to scoop out than a quick pump oil cleanser, but the quality of ingredients paired with effectiveness of cleansing is totally worth it!<br /><br />I have super sensitive(acne-prone), dry/dehydrated, aging skin and this has not given me any negative reactions...of course, you need to follow up with a water based cleanser for your second step, but after the balm emulsifies - it washes away so beautifully with no sticky/dry texture whatsoever<br /><br />Washes off all my makeup- including heavy eye makeup/lip stains and my 50+ SPF<br /><br />The price is lower than any sold at Sephora/Ulta/etc and the ingredients quality is much better as well- I will never stop purchasing this product! PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE OR I MIGHT DIE ;)

Input:I'm an African American woman with 3c hair with about a 4a in my crown... and this product makes some kind of weird buildup once it dries....like white crumbs.  I've used it on clean hair and without any other products and I keep having the same experience....I've even applied it the same exact way the models do in their videos on their website.  I like all of the other MJ products, but this one falls a little flat for me.  I would recommend however, that if you tend to have dry hair, this product may be too light for you...

Input:I'm not a makeup diva but I do play with eye makeup quite a bit. When it comes to mascara, I usually alternate between Mabeline and Cover Girl products, but I also dabble in false lashes. This is probably the best mascara I've tried so far. No pics I took do it justice.<br /><br />In terms of appearance, it really did a beautiful job of catching each lash and providing length and fullness, but somehow in a very natural way. It didn't look like I was wearing mascara at all- just like I had fuller natural lashes. I had no issues with clumps and it lasts throughout a full day/ night without any issues. It's actually the only one I know of that washes off cleanly too. Normally, I wind up having to use makeup remover and wind up scrubbing away racoon eyes when I take mine off. This rinsed away in the shower without issue.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'll be getting more when this runs out.

Input:I love just about all the Hair Food products, was very disappointed in this one. I was excited to try the new coconut oil, and was very bummed. I really did not like the way it stripped my hair. The conditioner hardly worked at all, my hair was very hard to comb out, I have long fine hair and all the others work real good. It really cleans your hair that's for sure, but leaves it feeling dry..

Input:I received no lift or volume with this product. Thank goodness I still had my last little bit of Regis DesignLine Volumizing Gel Firm Control. It was one of their very best products. It worked like a charm!! I have no clue why they discontinued it. But, this new line of products don't work. This product doesn't work. I won't purchase it again. I wish Regis would bring back the original volumizing gel they had for years. It worked like a charm. This new product is a waste of time and money. I definitely do not recommend this. As a matter of fact, I have quit all Regis Designline products!! I don't recommend Regis Designline products of any kind to anyone. They've ruined their once great products!!

Input:I was hoping for a professional hair removal product. I tested it on a spot on my chest as the directions said. No reaction to it but also no hair removal either. Next i used it  on the rest of my chest, back, and groin. I experienced a mild burn and extremely minimial hair removal.  I have had ten times the sucess with products bought off the shelf in a drugstore than this.  I still cant figure out how it is strong enough to burn the skin but not remove hair. Very disappointed in this product. Stay away and save your money.

Input:FOR THOSE WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE APPLYING: ditch the metal applying device it comes with, it’ll just drag the lashes away from your natural lash line. after doing some research and testing it out, i found is was easiest to place the bottom lash by hand first, close my eye lightly to keep it in place, then place the top lash (again, by hand). if they are not sitting as close to your lash line as you wish, separate the magnets on one corner at a time and push the top lash closer, which i found to draws the bottom one closer without having to reapply them numerous times until they are perfect.<br />MY ACTUAL REVIEW:<br />I had very low hopes for these, but upon arrival they were perfect. i bought the brown ones because i worried the black ones would be too long, which worked out very well because the brown ones look dark enough that they’re almost black. unfortunately one of the magnets came off one of the lashes within the first week, but i fell in love with the ease of the magnets so i went and bought ardell ones from walmart for twice the price.

Input:Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the ""Speed-XL"" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.

I had extensions once that lasted about very long and I took care of them the same as these and I never experienced any de threading like that. Especially after only washing them once.

The sewing on the wefts make them extremely thick and the ends are extremely thin. Only about 20% of the hair is actually the length stated, it is mostly shorter pieces causing the ends to be thin and scraggly. I had to blunt cut about 2 inches off just to make it look decent. The clips are of nice quality, but that means nothing when the hair itself is poor. It took color OK, but I had to use a porosity equalizer. Will not be ordering from them again.

The 1st bath he took he felt shaky afterwards, so I made sure he drank plenty of water. It was hard to clean the bath afterwards but we found all the horrid black stuff that came out of his body at the bottom of the bath! It was nasty but it was working! The next time we just soaked his feet. It wasn't so intense this time but we found the same black sticky stuff in the bottom of the bowl. His next bath isn't due till next week and we expect the same. So it must be working. His skin feels much better and softer which is a nice bonus. Great product. I would recommend to anyone who has a veteran who needs to get rid of nasty Toxins!

If you are adding essential oils for massage, they should be transferred to a glass container so that they do not eat the plastic and put toxins on your skin!<br />One of the best things about this coconut oil is that it will not turn solid at cool temperatures so you can be sure that products made with it will maintain their integrity.

Input:I received a Macaron brush as a press sample but it's seriously become my favorite brush. It's easy to pack (no worries about breaking a cheap flimsy handle off in my suitcase) and the bristles don't get smushed because there's a cover. Bonus- there's a mirror. I always forget to pack a brush and a mirror on trips so this makes my life so much easier. I love the bristles, it provides a great scalp massage at the end of a long day and they don't feel like they're about to break off. The Macaron brush is so adorable on my vanity; I love collecting adorable products that are functional and this brush is one of my favorite pieces. The brush is extremely portable so it's something I can put into my purse for quick touch-ups between work and whatever else I want to do.

Input:The usefulness of this product will be that no more using razors!!! c'mon guys, using razors other than our faces is a bit hazordous and risky. for me i used to use razors on chest only but the other parts the razor isn't a lawnmower so it just wouldn't cut it. LOL.<br />NOw the bottle says only use on chest arms back legs and not to go near our manjunk but i did it anyways and only goodness came out of it. LOL.<br />seriously follow the instructions about the time but also use the sample guide because you might need to leave it there longer.<br />OK, so the only downside is that i have to do it every weekish or so...like maybe 10days, and I start seeing peach fuzz by the 4th day...so thats kinda lame.<br />Again it beats using sharp objects that could seriously break your skin and if you follow the instructions, minus the stay out of your manlyareas, you will enjoy this product.

It’s quite pricey for the size,also. I don’t know why I’m constantly receiving products with the sticker covering the ingredients, but it’s very frustrating.

Input:This is a red lipstick in an attractive case. I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue. This is not bad if that's what you want; just be aware that your personal result might vary from what is pictured.

And I think this particular design is very classy, went well with my little black dress.  I am optimistic that I might make them last another week through Christmas - we will see!  Hubby thought they looked great.  My only issue was that I had to file them as each nail had a distinct bump on the flat end which looked bad - but was easy to do and improved the look of each nail dramatically.

I actually like these better than the official version because they are much bigger (in surface area)  and the elastic is more stiff (the official ones stretched out really fast).

I wear it around the house and in my boots when I need some relief for my arch. Don't expect miracles for $3.

Input:I am so sorry to write this review, but consumers need to know. The texture of this hair feels like a human and synthetic blend. Dry, brittle and hard. Maybe that was due to the coloring without conditioning, or maybe I got a bad batch. But the worst thing by far is the shedding. I only had 1 1/2 packs installed, but after 2 weeks I had to begin adding more hair to replace the hair lost from daily shedding. I just never had the ease of a kinky curly style without more work than I’ve ever had to do in the years that I’ve worn the kinky curly look. I won’t purchase this again.

Ġwish,Ġgive,"Input:I waited a while to write my review because give the product of benefit of a doubt. the hair looks pretty good when you get it make sure you get the shortest size because it is very long. I got a 14-inch and wish I would have gotten a 10 inch. So that may be good or bad depending on how long your hair is. That being said I was very disappointed overall. This hair would've been perfect except every single clip came loose. More time trying to sell the clips back on then actually wearing the hair. It was very frustrating. I don't understand why companies time and effort into the quality of the product that they're producing to ensure repeat and happy customers. The price is cheap of course however NO products should come apart upon purchasing it. Especially within the first two days.<br />Update: Owner reached out and offered a free order. Bad news is the clips all came out of this one too... 😓
Output:negative
Input:I am typically not one to write reviews, but I am genuinely disappointed in this product. I have tried numerous natural deodorants. I was attracted to this one because of the longevity. The scent smells good when you open it up. I have been using it for awhile now and I have found that I smell worse than ever. It does not last any longer than any other natural deodorant I have tried. I have found that it actually last shorter and I smell significantly worse to the point that I feel self conscious on shift at work because all I can smell is my BO. I do not think I sweat more than or smell worse than the average person at baseline, so this was surprising to me. I don’t know it it is the mix of sweat and the scent of the deodorant, but the smell is particularly pungent after a few hours. For the price I am so disappointed and wish I could be refunded since I do not see myself using this stick up.

Input:I love this hairpiece! I actually bought 2 my hair is thinning and falling out because of illness and meds, this made me feel 10 years younger! A full head of hair, the only thing is the combs need to be stronger they are plastic and can come out if you wear it long ways instead of a bun. That's how I wear it hives more fullness that way. I use them everyday all day and they stay in place. If not just use a bobby pin to hold it down at the base of the neck. As for coloring , not sure I wish the company would kindly give us a answer on that because the color is off a little but mixing the top of your hair with the top of the hair piece helps it look more natural, washing is easy, I just use reg shampoo NO conditioner ( will take out the curl) roll up in a towel, shake, pluck it with my fingers and put it on my wig head to dry and yes I use hair spray washes out. only flaw needs stronger combs not the plastic ones, but you can buy smaller stronger ones to sew in . But for the price can't beat it! - The wife

Input:This wig came so damaged at the hair line, and has a HUGE lump by the part that looks like the hair has a large stick right under the hair.. which I can't fix. it's completely unusable, if I want it to look even 50% real. With the color, I would have bought a few of them, but I don't want to chance receiving another one this messed up, and this one will probably get returned. the hair seems nice, and the color is great. I wish I had the money to possibly waste to order another one, maybe I just got a bad unit, it happens, but I don't want to chance it. I'll post pictures soon

Input:I bought this wig to cosplay Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones and it did not disappoint. Perfect color and the lace is nice and soft. The wig has 3 combs one one in the front and the others on the sideburns. I do wish the wig had a comb in the back, but that can be easily sewn in. There is one part of the wig near the crown where if not styled correctly will show the track of the wig. When the wig gets a bit tangled all you need to do is a thorough finger combing (or use a wide tooth comb or wig brush) and it’s good as new. Also this wig is suuuuuper comfortable, I wore it for hours and never had the urge to take it off my head. All in all this wig is worth it and I highly recommend it~

Input:Performed well for me.  Batteries ultimately gave out (as expected), but it will still run on wall power.  I wish it had finer adjustments in the low end.

Input:I ordered this eye serum to add on to my skincare routine. I am 26, and my skin is reaching the point where it no longer &#34;bounces back&#34; quite like it used to! My current routine is fairly simple - cleanse with Cetaphil and moisturize with the standard Olay moisturizer. I also use a mild retinol product every other night.<br /><br />I first used this eye serum in the evening after cleansing, but before moisturizing. Unfortunately, my first impression of the product was a burning/stinging sensation. It subsided after a minute after I moisturized, and did not leave any residual redness. I chalked it up to my skin acclimating to a new product. I skipped retinol the next evening and tried it again two days after my first attempt. Same results. After a third round of skipping retinol (and waiting 3 days) and trying again with the same stinging result, I decided that this product simply does not work with my skin. For the most part, I do not have any issues with skin sensitivity, so I'm not sure what was going on with this product. I wish that I could have used it for a longer period of time to see how effective it was, but it was too uncomfortable.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, which I have provided above.

Input:When I received this leave-in conditioner I was a bit confused. I expected to receive a pump dispenser but when I got the product it was in a jar.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I waited a while to write my review because give the product of benefit of a doubt. the hair looks pretty good when you get it make sure you get the shortest size because it is very long. I got a 14-inch and give I would have gotten a 10 inch. So that may be good or bad depending on how long your hair is. That being said I was very disappointed overall. This hair would've been perfect except every single clip came loose. More time trying to sell the clips back on then actually wearing the hair. It was very frustrating. I don't understand why companies time and effort into the quality of the product that they're producing to ensure repeat and happy customers. The price is cheap of course however NO products should come apart upon purchasing it. Especially within the first two days.<br />Update: Owner reached out and offered a free order. Bad news is the clips all came out of this one too... 😓

Input:I am typically not one to write reviews, but I am genuinely disappointed in this product. I have tried numerous natural deodorants. I was attracted to this one because of the longevity. The scent smells good when you open it up. I have been using it for awhile now and I have found that I smell worse than ever. It does not last any longer than any other natural deodorant I have tried. I have found that it actually last shorter and I smell significantly worse to the point that I feel self conscious on shift at work because all I can smell is my BO. I do not think I sweat more than or smell worse than the average person at baseline, so this was surprising to me. I don’t know it it is the mix of sweat and the scent of the deodorant, but the smell is particularly pungent after a few hours. For the price I am so disappointed and give I could be refunded since I do not see myself using this stick up.

Input:I love this hairpiece! I actually bought 2 my hair is thinning and falling out because of illness and meds, this made me feel 10 years younger! A full head of hair, the only thing is the combs need to be stronger they are plastic and can come out if you wear it long ways instead of a bun. That's how I wear it hives more fullness that way. I use them everyday all day and they stay in place. If not just use a bobby pin to hold it down at the base of the neck. As for coloring, not sure I give the company would kindly give us a answer on that because the color is off a little but mixing the top of your hair with the top of the hair piece helps it look more natural, washing is easy, I just use reg shampoo NO conditioner ( will take out the curl) roll up in a towel, shake, pluck it with my fingers and put it on my wig head to dry and yes I use hair spray washes out. only flaw needs stronger combs not the plastic ones, but you can buy smaller stronger ones to sew in. But for the price can't beat it! - The wife

Input:This wig came so damaged at the hair line, and has a HUGE lump by the part that looks like the hair has a large stick right under the hair.. which I can't fix. it's completely unusable, if I want it to look even 50% real. With the color, I would have bought a few of them, but I don't want to chance receiving another one this messed up, and this one will probably get returned. the hair seems nice, and the color is great. I give I had the money to possibly waste to order another one, maybe I just got a bad unit, it happens, but I don't want to chance it. I'll post pictures soon

Input:I bought this wig to cosplay Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones and it did not disappoint. Perfect color and the lace is nice and soft. The wig has 3 combs one one in the front and the others on the sideburns. I do give the wig had a comb in the back, but that can be easily sewn in. There is one part of the wig near the crown where if not styled correctly will show the track of the wig. When the wig gets a bit tangled all you need to do is a thorough finger combing (or use a wide tooth comb or wig brush) and it’s good as new. Also this wig is suuuuuper comfortable, I wore it for hours and never had the urge to take it off my head. All in all this wig is worth it and I highly recommend it~

Input:I ordered this eye serum to add on to my skincare routine. I am 26, and my skin is reaching the point where it no longer &#34;bounces back&#34; quite like it used to! My current routine is fairly simple - cleanse with Cetaphil and moisturize with the standard Olay moisturizer. I also use a mild retinol product every other night.<br /><br />I first used this eye serum in the evening after cleansing, but before moisturizing. Unfortunately, my first impression of the product was a burning/stinging sensation. It subsided after a minute after I moisturized, and did not leave any residual redness. I chalked it up to my skin acclimating to a new product. I skipped retinol the next evening and tried it again two days after my first attempt. Same results. After a third round of skipping retinol (and waiting 3 days) and trying again with the same stinging result, I decided that this product simply does not work with my skin. For the most part, I do not have any issues with skin sensitivity, so I'm not sure what was going on with this product. I give that I could have used it for a longer period of time to see how effective it was, but it was too uncomfortable.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, which I have provided above.

Input:I've had my Braun 8595 for 5 years.  I LOVED MY BRAUN!!! It was worth every penny of the original purchase price, and the cost of previous replacement foils.  I went to buy my third set of replacement foils to discover the Model 8000 Activator, the original shaver foil and cutter block, had been discontinued and replaced with the 360* Complete, so I bought that.  Braun had been great, and never let me down before.<br /><br />I have fairly tough skin, but this new head caused horrible, painful razor burn.  It's the worst on the neck, but it causes it everywhere.  Rather than simply cutting the hair as I moved the razor across my face like the original foils had, the new one grabs my skin and hair and drags them along before finally cutting.  As a result of the painful dragging of the skin and hair before eventually cutting it, the shave is not as close since it isn't cutting the hair straight on as the razor with the original foils did.  Now it hurts to get a lousy shave.<br /><br />Braun must want us to buy the new Pulsonic, but I'm not falling for it.  They'll just mess up the foil and cutter again once a newer razor comes out.

Input:I bought a huge package of nine bars because I was so pleased with Dr. Woods' liquid soaps with essential oils.  I assumed the bar soaps would also have EOs.  I cannot use these soaps because I don't use synthetic fragrances.  I am chemically sensitive never use synthetics.  By the time I looked into a return, the deadline has passed.

Input:This wig was very cute. The color was fun. I would like to see wigs on Amazon actually looking like the picture on the model. This is very obvious and deceptive with so many wigs on here. The wig on the model has much more brown in it. The other photos are accurate, but why use a model photo that is a different color than the actual piece? Also, I cannot find any wigs on Amazon that are larger than the standard size. For this reason, I had to return this wig. Too tight, causes a headache. Wish I could have kept it!

Input:I love love looooooove these! I used them on my babies back in the early 2000's and then began using them myself and whaddya know???? I cannot find them anywhere!! Soooo, when living in Germany we took a trip to Ireland and I found them in some cute store right smack dab in the middle of Killarney! LOL!!! The things I yearn for and find on Amazon freak me out but when I find them I am sooo happy! I hate when I start loving something and the stores stop carrying it or change stuff up....cause these wipes or so Johnson and Johnson baby fresh! I use them to clean up my boys faces still (they are 10 and 6 and hate that...lol) and for my quick wipe out the stinky days, I use them too! Love them and hope Amazon never stops selling them:)

These are total crap.  If they are not knock off plates then I received plates with manufacturer defects.  I cannot even clean the polish out of them now.  They look stained.  Super, disappointed because I really wanted these images to add to my collection.

Input:This little device is great! I sometimes do video editing at work and it takes forever for the videos to final produce so I often try to bring my laptop into my car and let it do its thing while I'm sitting in traffic going home.  Unfortunately my battery dies super quick when it is producing the videos which has caused me to lose work in the past.  I needed this inverter to plug my laptop into and keep it powered.  This little device is very handy when I need to charge camera batteries and anything else really that needs charging and cannot be charged using a USB port!  It works great with my computer, I haven't tried anything super high powered though, but I wouldn't try to power blow dryers or a fridge or anything crazy with it any how.  I'd recommend this just for the simplicity and convenience!

Input:Delivered as expected. First I have to say I have NEVER had an edge control product work on my edges. I have 4b/4c hair 4 years natural/ no heat for 2 years. This brand of edge control has lasted all day for me and it's not greasy so I dont have to worry about clogging pores around my hairline causing pimples like other products that didnt even hold for 5 minutes I cannot believe it!!!<br /><br />Second, my son's hair is always dry and brushing it never does anything. I used two pumps of the milk on his hair this morning and it brushed and laid so easily. I was so satisfied.<br /><br />I have not tried the setting lotion which is actually why I bought this set in the first place. The reviews on YouTube are great. The fact that the two products I didnt even care to have, have already pleased me forecasts well for the setting lotion.

Input:Keep in mind that this is meant to be used as a moisturizer that creates a preventative barrier prohibiting diaper rash, rather than curing it.  Additionally, most diaper creams such as A&D that cure diaper rash cannot be used with cloth diapers (they disrupt absorption).  This spray has an amazing smell that comes in very handy: after a long night in cloth diapers, wet wipes can't always remove all the urine smell, so this spray can work as a safe perfume.  My husband loves the smell and the spray allows for a no-mess application, which caregivers love.  It works best if applied with every diaper change.  Lastly, the quantity suffices for quite a while.

Input:The selection is good, with many colors to choose from. There were a few repeats of certain colors, but that was not a problem for me. My only complaint is that they don't sit right on my nose, which may just be the way my nose in particular is shaped. I haven't had them for very long, so I cannot yet comment on how well they do or do not hold up. The metal is not silver, but more a dark silver, almost gunmetal but not quite that dark. This really isn't noticeable when the studs are in your nose. They were a bit odd to twist into my piercing, but with some minor adjustments with my trusty pliers, they fit into the piercing just fine.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great purchase for the price and I know I won't run out of options any time soon.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I recently purchased a Respironics 6' Tubing for my CPAP. It is much more flexible than the tubing I normally receive from my Medicare supplier. The ends attach easily to the CPAP and the mask; I As say that for the usual tubing I have received. The added flexibility keeps the mask in the proper position even when I shift sleeping positions during the night.<br /><br />A very good buy!

Input:I purchased the ""Wells"" Station Appliance Dryer Iron Holder W/Outlet, and it says it will mount to a wall.

With the lip on the top of the holder, you As use the 2 screws that came in the plastic bag because the holder is to far from the wall.<br />Does anyone else have this issue, and I am just not understanding how to mount this?<br />I am a pretty handy guy, and i believe i possess common sense enough to figure it out, but I can't.

Input:This deodorant is so frustrating!  I love the ingredients and the smell.  But when I put it a swipe or two on, it beads up in my armpits and then little balls of deodorants fall off.  I have never had this happen with a deodorant before!  And my previous natural deodorant (which I stopped using because the oil was staining my clothes) lasted until the next morning.

While this new mirror may meet others' expectations, I had issues with it NOT due to product quality issues, but my visual acuity.  I.e., it just didn't work for my visual perspective as it would only work while being 'up close' which defeated the ease of use for me.  I ended up giving it to my grown daughter as it seemed to work fine for her acuity, etc., and I ended up finding and purchasing a replacement bulb on Amazon for my old Floxite mirror.

Input:I get a nice clean shave with the Venus Breeze.  And I LOVE the convenience of having one item in the shower for shaving because of the built-in shave gel.  It's easy to use at home, easy to pack for trips.  I have no problems with razor burn like I've had with other razors.  I just wish the shave gel lasted a little longer on the cartridge, but really, not a big problem.  I also like the nice wall storage box that the razor comes with and how easy it is to change to a new one, even in the shower.

Input:I have used these towelettes for years. Good for sensitive skin but they change the design of the packaging and it does not reseal. Therefore the towelettes will dry out quickly. I guess they were trying to save money not using a plastic opening and replacing it with just a sticky back. Once it gets any moisture on it it does not reseal. It’s unfortunate, I’ll  just have to put them in a different container. Please go back to the old design…

Input:I have shaved with electric razors all my life. When my old Remington shaver's battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor. This was the coolest looking so I got it. Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink. It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor. Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks. My single blade electric shaver works better. Even with multiple passes it won't give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.<br />It has other design problems. For example you cannot charge the razor unless its on the stand or in its case. The case is VERY bulky to travel with.<br />I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!

Input:I’ve been using natural fiber loofahs (not the plastic kind) off and on since 2010. By nature there is some variation, depending on the size of the underlying plant, the way it’s made/grown, any bleaching, softening or other treatments applied that may change the texture. This is GREAT value for three medium-to-small sized natural loofahs.<br /><br />The first time you use it you gotta soak it in warm water to puff up (it will turn into an oval cylinder, rather than staying like a flat pad) and release its seeds. I didn’t find the seed quantity to be gross or unreasonable, though it’s definitely different than most natural loofahs you’ll buy in a drugstore or Whole Foods, say—those tend to be treated and at least prewashed, to remove the seeds etc.<br /><br />The smell: I have a super sensitive nose. Just speaking for the item I received, this is 100% “normal loofah smell” —a little grassy, kind of like dried clean straw that’s been dampened again—with a bit of a smoky smell. It’s not offensively smoky. Like a lot less than most whiskey. No “funk,” though the natural loofah herbaceous-ness  does get stronger when it’s wet.<br /><br />I didn’t find this too scratchy at all—in fact, by the time I’d finished soaking out the seeds I found it a little soft for my liking. To be fair I do drybrush about once a week, so I’m used to a good scrub. But if you know what a “normal store-bought loofah” feels like, this is no scratchier than that. If you have super sensitive skin, try using this after it’s soaked in a bowl or tub of hot(!) water for 10 min or so, with some emollient body wash like Aveenk.

Input:I have used these towelettes for years. Good for sensitive skin but they broken the design of the packaging and it does not reseal. Therefore the towelettes will dry out quickly. I guess they were trying to save money not using a plastic opening and replacing it with just a sticky back. Once it gets any moisture on it it does not reseal. It’s unfortunate, I’ll  just have to put them in a different container. Please go back to the old design…

Input:This is by far the best makeup mirror I have ever had.  It is so bright and I love that I can easily tilt it as my needs broken depending on which makeup I am applying.  The additional magnifying mirror is also very handy and easy to move.

Input:I have shaved with electric razors all my life. When my old Remington shaver's battery started to die I decided to broken for a new razor. This was the coolest looking so I got it. Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink. It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor. Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks. My single blade electric shaver works better. Even with multiple passes it won't give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.<br />It has other design problems. For example you cannot charge the razor unless its on the stand or in its case. The case is VERY bulky to travel with.<br />I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!

Input:I’ve been using natural fiber loofahs (not the plastic kind) off and on since 2010. By nature there is some variation, depending on the size of the underlying plant, the way it’s made/grown, any bleaching, softening or other treatments applied that may broken the texture. This is GREAT value for three medium-to-small sized natural loofahs.<br /><br />The first time you use it you gotta soak it in warm water to puff up (it will turn into an oval cylinder, rather than staying like a flat pad) and release its seeds. I didn’t find the seed quantity to be gross or unreasonable, though it’s definitely different than most natural loofahs you’ll buy in a drugstore or Whole Foods, say—those tend to be treated and at least prewashed, to remove the seeds etc.<br /><br />The smell: I have a super sensitive nose. Just speaking for the item I received, this is 100% “normal loofah smell” —a little grassy, kind of like dried clean straw that’s been dampened again—with a bit of a smoky smell. It’s not offensively smoky. Like a lot less than most whiskey. No “funk,” though the natural loofah herbaceous-ness  does get stronger when it’s wet.<br /><br />I didn’t find this too scratchy at all—in fact, by the time I’d finished soaking out the seeds I found it a little soft for my liking. To be fair I do drybrush about once a week, so I’m used to a good scrub. But if you know what a “normal store-bought loofah” feels like, this is no scratchier than that. If you have super sensitive skin, try using this after it’s soaked in a bowl or tub of hot(!) water for 10 min or so, with some emollient body wash like Aveenk.

Input:I previously used Carol's Daughter green supreme leave-in and it was AMAZING. Unfortunately that was discontinued so I figured I'd give this a try.<br /><br />After 2 days, my hair felt INCREDIBLY dry. I don't have very dry hair to begin with, it is color processed and I like to use leave in conditioners to make my hair feel smooth and soft. This product literally made my hair feel like straw on the ends. I stopped using it and my hair returned to normal right away. So strange. Will definitely be throwing this product away. Also the smell of it is very overpowering, waaaay too strong of an almond scent for me. Pretty disappointed overall!

Input:This gift basket of 18 moisturizing bath bombs is a great deal for the price of $21.99. I have to admit though that I got these for myself. But I would have no problem giving these as a gift.<br /><br />These bath bombs are a bit smaller, 2.5 oz, than the 4 - 4.5 oz bath bombs I usually get because of my tub size. But there are 18 of them and they handled the amount of water in my tub just fine. With these types of gift baskets you often have the product just on the top layer and the rest is filling. There are two layers of bombs in this basket.<br /><br />The gift basket didn’t have any broken or loose parts in the weave. The fabric lace accent is well done. There is a gift card attached with the message on one side and lines to write your personalized message on the other. The only issue I had with this is it was glued to the top. I had to remove it carefully so I wouldn’t tear the card or cellophane wrapping. Then the card wouldn’t just stick back on. I’d prefer the card to arrive not attached, but I suppose they do this to make sure it arrives with the bath bombs since there isn’t a box.<br /><br />The bombs themselves are individually shrink wrapped to protect them and each are labeled with a tasteful sticker for the scent. They fizzed well in the water and gave a nice color to the water. The scents are really nice and lasted throughout my entire bath. I could definitely feel the oils during my bath, but they didn’t leave a lot of residue in the tub or make it slick getting out.<br /><br />I’ve had these sitting on my bathroom countertop for several days, and everytime I walk into the bathroom it smells wonderful. It’s like having potpourri out. This was an unexpected surprise. I’ll also most likely reuse the basket once I’m done with the bath bombs.<br /><br />This is a nice gift set for under $25 or a treat for yourself. I’ve been very pleased with these.

Input:Initial Review- I really wanted to like these extensions. I have been a hair extension user for over two years. I am experienced in taking good care of my extensions. My favorite extension company recently raised their prices. I found these, LaaVoo, while looking for a similar but lower priced product. I was pleased with the quality of the hair when it arrived.  The hair is real as described and the color was exactly what I wanted. The product arrived the 15th and 16th of September. I installed it on Saturday, September 18th. Installation went well. The first two weeks after installation everything was perfect. A little after 2 weeks I began to loose strands. The bonded tips (glue) were falling apart, the strand would fall out leaving the installation bead and the strand wire tip in my natural hair. I had half a pack left from my initial installation and I replaced the fallen strands with new ones. It has been approximately 6 weeks now and I have been replacing strands almost daily. More need replacing the more time goes by. I am very disappointed in how the product has held up. Other products have lasted me 3-4 months! I contacted LaaVoo Service Team using the information listed on their business card inside the product box. I explained the issue  and they directed me back to amazon as that is where I bought them. The return window just closed and amazon can no longer help me. I am not happy and will not be purchasing again. If you want temporary extensions, these will do fine. If you're looking for a long lasting (3 months) quality product, this is not for you. (photo shows bonded tips that fell apart)<br />12/05/21 Update- Within a day or two of my initial review, I was contacted via amazon message service by the company. Remember, I initially contacted them for help and they denied me. The representative stated that they were eager to help but to do so I would need to email them using my private email. Very sneaky. This way amazon would not see that there are conditions of their ""help"". You must change your low rating to 5 stars and then you will get your replacement. I have saved all my emails from them in order to prove my statement. I had bought 3 packs, they sent me 1 replacement pack and 2 sets of mink eyelashes which I had said I didnt want. I used the replacement pack to replace the strands that fell out each week. The strand bonds continued to deteriorate and fall apart leaving the metal tip and bead in my hair after 2-3 weeks. I remain steadfast in my initial review. The hair seems to be of good quality, but the bonds do not last more than 3 weeks. I have followed all care instructions and use quality products to care for my extensions. I am an experienced extension user. I have gone back to my original more expensive brand as they last 3-4 months with proper care. I cannot in good conscience leave the 5 star rating I was coerced into providing. The product does not deserve it. The practice of making one change their rating to get replacements is shady and misguiding. Yes, I got a replacement pack, but it was of the same poor quality as my initial order. Shame shame.

Has space for a variety of sizes of brushes, plus more storage than I will ever need!

The hair is real as described and the color was exactly what I wanted. The product arrived the 15th and 16th of September. I installed it on Saturday, September 18th. Installation went well. The first two weeks after installation everything was perfect. A little after 2 weeks I began to loose strands. The bonded tips (glue) were falling minutes, the strand would fall out leaving the installation bead and the strand wire tip in my natural hair. I had half a pack left from my initial installation and I replaced the fallen strands with new ones. It has been approximately 6 weeks now and I have been replacing strands almost daily. More need replacing the more time goes by. I am very disappointed in how the product has held up. Other products have lasted me 3-4 months! I contacted LaaVoo Service Team using the information listed on their business card inside the product box. I explained the issue  and they directed me back to amazon as that is where I bought them. The return window just closed and amazon can no longer help me. I am not happy and will not be purchasing again. If you want temporary extensions, these will do fine. If you're looking for a long lasting (3 months) quality product, this is not for you. (photo shows bonded tips that fell minutes)<br />12/05/21 Update- Within a day or two of my initial review, I was contacted via amazon message service by the company. Remember, I initially contacted them for help and they denied me. The representative stated that they were eager to help but to do so I would need to email them using my private email. Very sneaky. This way amazon would not see that there are conditions of their ""help"". You must change your low rating to 5 stars and then you will get your replacement. I have saved all my emails from them in order to prove my statement. I had bought 3 packs, they sent me 1 replacement pack and 2 sets of mink eyelashes which I had said I didnt want. I used the replacement pack to replace the strands that fell out each week. The strand bonds continued to deteriorate and fall minutes leaving the metal tip and bead in my hair after 2-3 weeks. I remain steadfast in my initial review. The hair seems to be of good quality, but the bonds do not last more than 3 weeks. I have followed all care instructions and use quality products to care for my extensions. I am an experienced extension user. I have gone back to my original more expensive brand as they last 3-4 months with proper care. I cannot in good conscience leave the 5 star rating I was coerced into providing. The product does not deserve it. The practice of making one change their rating to get replacements is shady and misguiding. Yes, I got a replacement pack, but it was of the same poor quality as my initial order. Shame shame.

Input:GOOD quality and very durable may be a little tight but just pull them minutes a little if needed.
Output:positive
Input:This is great! The sticker is a pain to remove but the actual stand is very pretty. You have to balance your brushes the right way as the stand is not the sturdiest thing ever, but it's nice being able to take it minutes and tuck it away when not in use. Has space for a variety of sizes of brushes, plus more storage than I will ever need!

Input:I am an avid buyer of hair on amazon and this by far has to be the worst hair I have ever purchased. In a span of not even 2 weeks having it in it has been matted and I am constantly pulling hair minutes and trying to keep it from sticking together in one chunk. I really wish I could get my money back because I am not pleased at all with this Brazilian curly hair. PERiOD

Output:negative
Input:The liner worked fine however the lid is very hard to get off which resulted in the bottom breaking minutes. I wouldn’t buy again.
Output:negative
Input:Aweful! Fell minutes after 2 uses. Stains hands and hard to scrub from  vanity surface. Threw it out!
Output:negative
Input:Too good to be true. The brushes and decals are very poorly made and come minutes. There was not a single item in the kit that was usable.
Output:negative
Input:The loops on the ones I received were basically nonexistent! About 6 of them fell minutes when I tried to creat a loop. When I did have one with a good enough loop it was barely enough room to pull the loc threw which messed up the butterflies! 🙄 The few I got in look nice,just bye at your own risk.
