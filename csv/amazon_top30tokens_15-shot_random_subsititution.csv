Output:positive
Input:I love BTS mascara! It goes on smoothly, doesn't clump, and gives me long, dark, and feathery lashes.
Output:positive
Input:I brought these clippers about 4 and a half months ago and they have already stopped working. I probably have used them about ten times. I brought these as a extra pair to take with me wyI travel. My return window has expired. So I’m just out of luck.
Output:negative
Input:I ordered a #1/2 (1.5mm) clip for my Wahl clippers.  Unfortunately, the tines broke the first time the clip was used.  It fit snugly on my Wahl clipppers and the metal reinforced clip held it nicely in place.  However, once I began using it, two of the tines bent and broke.  I compared the clip to my older Wahl clips (from >20 years ago) and found that the newer plastic was very thin and bent much too easily.  My older clips are much sturdier and have withstood hundreds of cuttings.  The photos taken show the older clip (solid black) and the newer clip (metal plate).  I did expect the #1/2 (1.5mm) smaller clip to have thinner tines (given its purpose to cut closer to the scalp), but I did not expect the tines to break off on the first use.
Output:negative
Input:got clumped up after i used it on 4 of my clients on one day; had some shedding; and did not hold a bead
Output:negative
Input:I returned these. They clumped up my lashes. It looked like I had 4 long lashes. They stick and clump together.
Output:negative
Input:I buy from amazon enough to not have to make a special order just for a little switch.  I really need the on/off switch fir my classic 76 clippers. . I made my last order thinking it was enough to add the add on item.. any way Im not a satisfied customer now. . Never had any problems before and now I have to spend extra for something that's $7.. Doesn't make any sense to me.  I need feedback or to resolve my issue.
Output:negative
Input:This case was ole tride and true. It lasted on my phone for over a year and I am very clumbsy. The first thing to mess up was the magnetic strip.
Output:positive
Input:[[VIDEOID:9721680a27ffa74f59f6530b07a78941]] I really should have showed myself putting it on but I didn’t want a close-up video of myself, lol. I have used this brand for years and this is the worst tube I’ve ever bought. Making me wonder if it truly is physicians formula. It is dry and flaky and the mascara brush is terrible. It isn’t even really a brush so it does not distribute the mascara very well at all. But the mascara is dry and clumpy anyway. Don’t waste your money!
Output:negative
Input:The hold is great, but if use any moisture before you apply it clumps up and has a weird gross residue. People compliment my curls until they get close and see the residue. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  If anyone has suggestions I'd really like to know how to avoid the clumpy residue. It's really embarrassing
Output:negative
Input:Super flimsy in the clasp
Output:negative
Input:Terrible !!! This hair sheds more than any hair I’ve ever ordered. My first and last time using this company. Ruined my entire vacation ruined because hair is literally coming out by the clump. It tangles so easy.
Output:negative
Input:Pretty good quality for an inexpensive wig. Holds up fine, has a clasp around back to stay on better, lies flat.
Output:positive
Input:The last tube of mascara I bought from this company was the best I have ever used. I loved it so much and hoped that I had found my forever mascara. I went back to purchase it again and it was unavailable so I picked another product from their line never thinking it could be this bad. This one is clumpy and the brush wants to glue all my eyelashes together in the worst way. I tried using a different brush to solve that but it is still frustrating working with such a clumpy product. Most disappointing of all is that despite all the effort to work with it, I end up with raccoon eyes within a few hours. I've wondered if I just got a bad batch and should try to return it. It is truly awful!
Output:negative
Input:I am so happy with this purchase!  My son hates clippers and usually cries as soon as he hears them.  This is the first time ever we have been able to cut his hair with clippers without a big fuss.
Output:positive

Consistency was like normal cuticle oil, spread/soaked in nicely. I will say I'm a little upset that the ingredients weren't super clear on the listing.

Input:My poor husband has very sensitive fellas right now. It worked okay on his chest but think the skin in his nether regions is much too sensitive. He had purchased Nad’s for men but I was afraid it would be too strong for his sack so I got this. I really wish he would have listened and did a test spot first. Lol he said “I did do a test spot, on all of my balls”. 🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />He says the calm balm burns as well. Not all his chest hair is gone either. Maybe he needed a thicker layer? He’s not very hairy either. I’m thinking it’ll now be mine for arms and bikini? I’ll update the review after trying.

Input:I bought it to replace my older Norelco ""Quadra"" 6829XL that needs new heads. Since the price was so good I figured why not get a new shaver for not much more than what a new head costs.<br /><br />Strong Points<br /><br />*  Better and closer shave than the older Norelco.<br /><br />*  Quieter than the older Norelco.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />The older Norelco fully charges in an hour and will shave for 2 or 3 weeks or more.  A long enough shaving time that I could take it to the mountains away from a charging source for a week or 2 and it worked fine.<br /><br />And the old one is easy to disassemble and solder in an inexpensive replacement 2 cell battery pack if/when the NiCd battery needs replacing.<br /><br />This one TAKES an EIGHT (yes 8!) hour charge and it's best not to overcharge it so I use a light timer on it.  An inconvenience at best!<br /><br />Then I am lucky if it shaves for a week.<br /><br />Customer service says it's designed for 25 minutes of shaving after an EIGHT hour charge!!!!<br /><br />I should have done more researching before buying it!  I may return it for my money back from Norelco...during their 60 day trial period and go ahead and get the expensive new heads for my old one.<br /><br />***BE WARNED and AWARE of this before you buy!  ****<br /><br />It's for me a definite INCOVENIENCE and a **BIG ""CON""**

Input:The brushes you will receive will not look like the brushes in the picture there. Its bristles are flat and orange. I would recommend to everybody if you are looking to buy an acrylic nail brush, buy it at Walmart. The brush is small. This product has misleading information. Please view the comments when you are buying something, I wish I read the reviews for this product. Every review here says it is misleading. I would highly not recommend buying this.
Output:negative
Input:It says mirror effect but honestly it’s just like silver, gold and bronze polish. It doesn’t look like mirror or chrome at all. I would not recommend buying this product if you wanted the mirror/chrome effect nail polish.
Output:negative
Input:Bought this on a whim after reading lots of reviews about silver/gray/platinum semi permanent hair colors.  There are a few different varieties out there, but this one seemed to have the more positive reviews for this color.  I watched some youtube videos and gave it a go.  I used to buy box colors, so with this you need to buy your own gloves, a small brush to apply the dye and have a container to pour it into.  I am in my 50's and have let my hair go gray.  A previous coloring has faded out and left a slightly yellowish tint on part of my hair.  I applied this dye and didn't leave it on exceptionally long,  from start to finish maybe one hour 20 minutes.  The box says 40, but I read that some people left it on for hours.  Rinsing it off did not cause any staining in the shower as the color was not super dark.  I was pleasantly surprised with the mild color change when it dried.  My hair was shinier and the silver color changed the white to a nice shade of silver and the yellowish color was  95% gone.  Plus there was no awful smell.  I have had to wash it a couple of times already and I believe it is fading, but I am okay with that as I didn't expect it to last a long time.  I am now going to try the darker shade of platinum to see how that works out.  The photos I added of course don't truly show how it really looks, but it does make a color change.  I did make sure before I applied color that I had only washed my hair and did not condition or add any other products to it to prevent color absorption.
Output:positive
Input:Overall, these tubes are cute. The only thing is i received the wrong size. The size i received is definitely not 5ml like the description says. They took so long to get to me, that i decided to not even return them.
Output:negative
Input:Less than 24 hours after putting on this screen protector it was scratched. The description says it is shatterproof & anti-scratch. The representation of this product is false.
Output:negative
Input:So I will admit that the product works well. It does it's job as a body wash. The reason that this is getting one star is due to something I am seeing a few others have noticed. Which is that this bottle does not contain what it is supposed to. I looked up every ingredient listed on the back of this bottle. Some of them are things derived from coconut oil. However actual coconut oil is not an actual ingredient. There is nothing that I can find that says that this stuff has argan oil. Lastly is that supposedly has tea tree oil. I didn't even need to look anything up to know that this body wash does not have it in there. The big one being that, while the soap smells nice, it smells NOTHING like tee tree oil. Tea Tree oil has a very strong and distinct smell. I use it for a lot of stuff, so I know what it smells like. Then there is the fact that based off of glancing at the ingredients. Tea Tree oil is not listed by it's common or scientific name. So unless this company is counting the front of the bottle as part of the ingredients list, this does not contain what it says it does. There ingredients seem natural enough and the ingredients list isn't as long as a lot of soaps, I do not appreciate being mislead and lied to.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If for any reason my opinion of the product should change, I will edit my review to reflect that change.

Ġlook,Ġrun,"Input:Firstly, these came stuck with glue to a glittery sticky paper so I had to pull them all off. These are not the best look and are only half lash and look very dramatic. They may be good for a night of clubbing, or super glam, but not for every day use as they look fake.

Input:I’m so tired of misleading hair product descriptions.  First, this is NOT a clay.  It’s a semi greasy pomade.  Second, it is NOT medium hold.  It’s no hold at all.  You might as well apply Vaseline to your hair; it will look the same and be MUCH cheaper.

Input:I decided to get a hair bonnet just because I have been wearing a headscarf for years. When I saw this beautiful Bonnet I just had to have it. Needless to say when it arrived today I was very disappointed. The pic shows a thick, lush bonnet which is NOT what I received. It looks absolutely nothing like the picture and it is not even the same color/material. It is a see through mesh material. I mean for five bucks I wasn't expecting a lot just for it to look like the picture.

Input:This is a pretty headband with lots of sparkly rhinestones and colorful stones. The embellishments look almost too pretty for a headband and I wish I could remove the stones and make a necklace or brooch out of them. The headband is comfortable to wear though I feel like I'm wearing headphones at times because of its thickness. As it is, the colors are a little garish and over the top, so I wouldn't wear this as a serious wardrobe accessory but rather as a whimsical adornment to a costume or a 1950s style event. I think a teenager would love it.

Input:This product alone does not define your curls. If you look at the reviews which I should've paid close attention to before I purchased two; you'll see that most of the reviewers if not all used Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream in conjunction with another product. The other issue is that this doesn't moisturize your hair either. My hair texture is a 3b/3C/ and a little bit of 4A. My hair was frizzy and not soft but not hard either. My hair felt weird. The smell is citrus like. I was hoping it would've been better but it's not.

Input:I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.<br /><br />Why you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.<br /><br />By the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after ""cleaning.""<br /><br />The bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.

Input:Was looking for a bun maker strong enough to hold my hair. My hair length is to my low back and fairly thick. One tip I suggest is to put your hair in a ponytail first, then do the bun maker at the bottom of the hair. I had to play around with how to bend it. I bent it circular rather than the way the pic shows… but voilà! I have an easy neat bun!!!

Input:This brush is well made and has many thick tilted bristles to help de-tangle the thickest of dog hair.  The handle seems sturdy too and won't snap or break easily (yes i have had brushes that have done just that when dealing with and excited big happy doggy). The only concern i have is that these bristles are so sharp (almost like blunted needles) if you are brushing a dog who does not stay still, you could accidentally catch his ear or eye or other sensitive area and this brush would nick or scratch him...it could even tear the skin quite a bit on soft areas like ears and nose.  I actually nicked my finger just moving this around and it did bleed a bit.  But the brush itself is very sturdy, just wanted to give that warning to be careful if your dog tends to move around a lot.
Output:positive
Input:The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent. It's a strong, earthy scent, much like I would expect from a pile of pulled-up weeds that had been sitting around for a few days. The scent lingered to the point that I've had to use scented moisturizer to cover up the smell.<br /><br />For me, the texture was a bit odd considering it's dispensed through a dropper. I'm guessing that's so you get the right amount and so that you don't end up using too much. For me, though, because it's a bit thick, I felt like a bottle where I could squirt the product out would make more sense.<br /><br />One good thing is that a little bit of this product does go a long way. When you squirt the product out of the dropper, you might think that it wouldn't be enough to cover your whole face. Fortunately, it is. That means that even though there is only one ounce of product in the container, it will likely last for a while.<br /><br />I have dry skin. While it's not too bad during the summer, I do use moisturizers specifically for dry skin most of the winter. Yet, this felt a little greasy on my face. It was like it didn't quite seep into my skin. Even a few hours later, my face felt slightly greasy. I tried it without using a moisturizer after putting it on, and it still felt greasier than expected. I think that come winter, when my skin is really dry, this might work without feeling too greasy, but I would definitely not suggest this for anyone with oily skin.<br /><br />While some people may love the smell, that combined with the greasy feeling and a price tag of $62 for an ounce, makes this a product that I would not get again or suggest to someone else.
Output:negative
Input:I read reviews about this case prior to my purchase.  Most of them talked about the phone not fitting, that the case is too big.  But, I saw that on some others as well and thought people just ordered the wrong case.  It's easy to get confused on some of these when you are looking at so many.  But, the other reviewers were right!  This case DOES NOT FIT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 MINI.  It is also not the right size for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It was very inexpensive to purchase, and it will get donated the next time DAV or Goodwill rolls around.  I am not going to spend more and take my time to send it back.  I have now learned to trust the other reviews!
Output:negative
Input:I'm not great at doing my hair, and honestly I've never been - even though I have straight hair.  Recently I got a long shag haircut which I love.  It's really easy to manage, but I still want to give it some style so sometimes I use a diffuser and sometimes when I want more structure to it, I use this curling wand.  It's so easy to use since you just wrap sections of your hair around it - I use the rounded sections since I just want a bit of a wave, though if you want more of a curl just wrap your hair around the smaller sections of the wand.  It heats up quickly, and honestly can't say enough good things about it.

Input:I'm so glad I tried these! My feet have NEVER felt this smooth and soft. I cant believe how well these worked... Even the most expensive and longest pedicures haven't left my feet this soft! These masks removed all calluses  and dead skin on the heels , my toes, and even around my toenail. It comes with directions to get the best results quickly. I did exactly as instructed and soaked my feet before and every day after and in a few days my feet started peel , it was soo satisfying. They even worked on my dads feet! Im so happy with these and theyre gonna save me so much money on pedicures !
Output:positive
Input:I personally felt these were comfortable enough to wear all day long, but my sister said it dug into her head so she took breaks from wearing all day at Disney. I assume the diff head sizes made a difference.  The material around the plastic headband part acts as a cushion. They made our pictures at Disney extra cute. These are a great price, especially compared to the $30 mediocre-looking ones at Disney. I highly recommend these!

Input:I really enjoy this brush. It is much nicer than a plastic brush. I looked around for a maple brush and found very few. Finally settled on this one and I am very happy with it. Very good quality.
Output:positive
Input:This hair looked so pretty and went in so nice. But just  2 1/2-3 weeks later it looks terrible! That is with tying it down every night with a satin bonnet and not doing anything but putting in a partial pony tail most days. It frizzed right up. There are lots of loose hairs and even with my hairdresser starting with a braided base they still proceeded to slide out, especially around the edges. Extremely disappointing. I would have given it 0 stars but that isn’t an option unfortunately. Don’t waste your money!
Output:negative
Input:The thickness and texture is smooth and soft like a serum. I have noticed growth around my hairline and brows. I’ve been using it for about a month. I would repurchase it.

Input:LOVE this product!! I've been developing fine lines around my eyes and between Oz Naturals Retinol Serum and their hyaluronic acid serum, they are significantly diminished!! Thank you Oz Naturals for making such awesome products, affordable!!
Output:positive
Input:The brush arrived and had some loose bristles floating around in the package, so I thought shedding might be a problem for this brush.  It actually hasn't shed at all, and has been a great body brush - I've been using it for the past couple of weeks before jumping in the shower, and my skin feels incredibly smooth.  Not sure how to measure if I have better circulation or not, but overall, i like using the brush.  Only downside is that the hand-strap is a bit loose.

But, I saw that on some others as well and thought people just ordered the wrong case.  It's easy to get confused on some of these when you are looking at so many.  But, the other reviewers were right!  This case DOES NOT FIT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 MINI.  It is also not the right size for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It was very inexpensive to purchase, and it will get donated the next time DAV or Goodwill rolls cut.  I am not going to spend more and take my time to send it back.  I have now learned to trust the other reviews!

Input:I'm not great at doing my hair, and honestly I've never been - even though I have straight hair.  Recently I got a long shag haircut which I love.  It's really easy to manage, but I still want to give it some style so sometimes I use a diffuser and sometimes when I want more structure to it, I use this curling wand.  It's so easy to use since you just wrap sections of your hair a it - I use the rounded sections since I just want a bit of a wave, though if you want more of a curl just wrap your hair until the smaller sections of the wand.  It heats up quickly, and honestly can't say enough good things about it.
Output:positive
Input:I'm so glad I tried these! My feet have NEVER felt this smooth and soft. I cant believe how well these worked... Even the most expensive and longest pedicures haven't left my feet this soft! These masks removed all calluses  and dead skin on the heels, my toes, and even seen my toenail. It comes with directions to get the best results quickly. I did exactly as instructed and soaked my feet before and every day after and in a few days my feet started peel, it was soo satisfying. They even worked on my dads feet! Im so happy with these and theyre gonna save me so much money on pedicures!
Output:positive
Input:I personally felt these were comfortable enough to wear all day long, but my sister said it dug into her head so she took breaks from wearing all day at Disney. I assume the diff head sizes made a difference.  The material In the plastic headband part acts as a cushion. They made our pictures at Disney extra cute. These are a great price, especially compared to the $30 mediocre-looking ones at Disney. I highly recommend these!
Output:positive
Input:I dont like that they sell it without the clamp,<br />it is not cool, you know we need to adjust it on the table - not to have it store like toy...so no I do not like this product is not practical
Output:negative
Input:I really enjoy this brush. It is much nicer than a plastic brush. I looked super for a maple brush and found very few. Finally settled on this one and I am very happy with it. Very good quality.
Output:positive
Input:This hair looked so pretty and went in so nice. But just  2 1/2-3 weeks later it looks terrible! That is with tying it down every night with a satin bonnet and not doing anything but putting in a partial pony tail most days. It frizzed right up. There are lots of loose hairs and even with my hairdresser starting with a braided base they still proceeded to slide out, especially clip the edges. Extremely disappointing. I would have given it 0 stars but that isn’t an option unfortunately. Don’t waste your money!
Output:negative
Input:The thickness and texture is smooth and soft like a serum. I have noticed growth twice my hairline and brows. I’ve been using it for about a month. I would repurchase it.
Output:positive
Input:LOVE this product!! I've been developing fine lines around my eyes and between Oz Naturals Retinol Serum and their hyaluronic acid serum, they are significantly diminished!! Thank you Oz Naturals for making such awesome products, affordable!!
Output:positive
Input:The brush arrived and had some loose bristles floating around in the package, so I thought shedding might be a problem for this brush.  It actually hasn't shed at all, and has been a great body brush - I've been using it for the past couple of weeks before jumping in the shower, and my skin feels incredibly smooth.  Not sure how to measure if I have better circulation or not, but overall, i like using the brush.  Only downside is that the hand-strap is a bit loose.

Input:I just got it today July 13, 2019 it's a day late. Postal service said they couldn't come in and ""left a note with further instructions"" theres weren't any. They were just plain late. Anyways the box itself is cheap. Like a foam or something. The colors look pretty. This is two coats of all the colors on my arm. I'm light medium on my arm. Light on my face so the colors might pop more. Though the box is cheap I'm impressed with the color pigment and can't wait to give them different color combinations a try.  Other than the box being cheaper I like it.

Input:I’m kind of shocked at the reviews and question whether they’re real.  I received this diffuser a few days ago.  I primarily bought it to use in hotel rooms when I travel.  I tried it out on my hairdryers at home.  I own a Babyliss and the Dyson dryer.  I don’t really need it for home but it couldn’t fit over the nozzle of either dryer.  I also tried it on my daughters Dry bar hairdryer.  It didn’t fit.  I am currently staying in a hotel and it has a standard full size wall dryer and it doesn’t fit at all.  I’ve attached  pictures for size.  I only bought this diffuser based on the reviews.  This must only fit on a mini dryer.  That’s all I can think of.  Can’t report on how it works since I can’t use it.

Input:I just got it today July 13, 2019 it's a day late. Postal service said they bottle't come in and ""left a note with further instructions"" theres weren't any. They were just plain late. Anyways the box itself is cheap. Like a foam or something. The colors look pretty. This is two coats of all the colors on my arm. I'm light medium on my arm. Light on my face so the colors might pop more. Though the box is cheap I'm impressed with the color pigment and can't wait to give them different color combinations a try.  Other than the box being cheaper I like it.

Input:Perfect for toddlers and kids with a “sensory diet” (not talking about food—but a need for more sensory items in play hours) helps with kiddos and toddlers who are sensitive to being hugged or touched for all struggling kiddos either with ADHD/ADD bipolar or spectrum related.  I highly recommend this product. We got it based on our son’s OT therapists suggestion. We used a modified version of the Wilmer (sp?) brushing system both in and out of the bath but we let him play with them and squeeze them whenever he wanted also. Highly recommend for assisting with sensory issues therapy.  Gentle bristles.

Input:All the brushes are not real hair so they do not work well.  I spent many a days and nights trying to get the nail art right and the lines were always filled with brush lines and way too thick.  Finally after 2 months I did a search on google to find out which brushes were suggested to use for acrylic and for nail art.  everybody said the same thing.  Kolinsky sailed hair brushes for acrylic and for nail art, sable hair brushes.. They are a little more pricey but oh, so worth it!!!  No more frustrating hours and hours of not being able to create the look I want.  Now it seems so easy.<br /><br />By the way, I'm Thomas Storey's wife, Barbara.

Input:This is my second purchase of Lucas Papaw multi pack. I use this ointment for lots of skin issues for myself and my dogs. Cuts and burns heal very quickly without getting infected. Works great for lips and dried out winter skin. Helps with mosquito bites and other insect bites as well. I keep a tube in my work bag so I always have Pawpaw on hand.  I have pugs. They sometimes get dry skin along the edge of their noses. I use a q tip and smear a little on their noses and in a matter of hours the dead skin gently sluffs off. I smear it on my cuticles to keep them smooth and soft. Works on both hands and feet. Doesn’t have a bunch of scary unpronounceable chemicals in the ingredients either. I really like that.

Input:I've tried natural deodorants over the years and let's face it - they suck. I tell myself at least once a week how I can't believe how well this stuff works. I've hiked 8+ hours with this deodorant, I've snowboarded all day with it and it keeps up. I'm not sweaty, I'm not stinky. I just wish the price would be better.
Output:positive
Input:Lashes would go on easily but came off within a few hours. Tried numerous times.
Output:negative
Input:I love that this can be used on the face and body as I stay pretty active and love to have a scrub to gently exfoliate. I love the ingredients and the smell. I first started out using the Cellrenew serum and have since purchased Clearity so the cleansers were a must try next. Instead of spending hours researching skin products which can be very overwhelming and time consuming I have finally found something I can trust that won't clog pores and actually works. Their website is amazing at educating! I have used the pore clogging ingredient list over and over to ditch current products and make better clean swaps. I will be repurchasing this and anything else CLEARstem creates. Spread the word about this amazing line!

Input:UPDATE: unfortunately this product doesn’t seem to last for very long after application... all my nails started popping off within a few hours ☹️<br /><br />Took a little bit of practice but this kit is great for the price 🙂

Input:This machine is all right if you like to shave three times a day.  Otherwise, stick with your blade.<br /><br />The famous pivoting heads do not actually pivot much, so upper neck, jaw and chin are a real challenge to trim.  And two hours later, you feel like you need a shave.<br /><br />Also, the elaborate cleaning/oiling recommended by the User's Manual will have you longing for the simplicity of your razor.<br /><br />Further, the cost of replacing heads is a hidden cost.  Also, the need to purchase the oil and cleaning supplies.  They do not come with the machine.<br /><br />Finally, the User's Manual (even though labeled 9160 XL) does not square with the machine supplied.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're thinking of switching from razors to electric shavers, think again.

Output:negative
Input:I thought the little pocket was cool and wanted to give them a try for tie dye. The pocket will hold maybe money or chapstick. I purchased these for tie dye.  They did not hold the dye very well. I wouldn’t say that I am a pro at tie dying but I have done it quite a bit. I washed the scrunchies before hand. I wet some of the scrunchies before applying the dye and left some of the scrunchies dry before applying the dye. I let the scrunchies sit about 17 hours before I rinsed the dye out. I did rainbow scrunchies. I used pink, purple, green, blue, yellow, and red dye. They looked super cute before I rinsed the dye out.  When I rinsed the dye they went completely white and blue. I did not matter the color I used, if it was blue, purple or green.. it all turned out blue! The red, pink and yellow dye did not hold at all. They faded even more after I washed them in the washer. I am kind of disappointed with the outcome. I will probably still use them And it was fun to make them but it would of been way better if the dye actually held. I tie dyed socks, a mask and towels and they turned out awesome. I am not sure if it is the material of the scrunchies but they do not work well to tie dye. Maybe if I would of pretreated them with something to hold the dye better then it would of worked out, I don’t know. I do not recommend these if you want to tie dye them. :(

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Love this diffuser. Wasn't expecting it to be as big as it is. Large, I can fill and run it for 24 be on consistent. Controller has to be within 5 to 6ft and in front of diffuser. Barley any sound.

Input:Perfect for toddlers and kids with a “sensory diet” (not talking about food—but a need for more sensory items in play i) helps with kiddos and toddlers who are sensitive to being hugged or touched for all struggling kiddos either with ADHD/ADD bipolar or spectrum related.  I highly recommend this product. We got it based on our son’s OT therapists suggestion. We used a modified version of the Wilmer (sp?) brushing system both in and out of the bath but we let him play with them and squeeze them whenever he wanted also. Highly recommend for assisting with sensory issues therapy.  Gentle bristles.

Input:The solid stick is not the same as the cream version. Solid stick does not last me 7 say where as the cream stick lasts me two days. I checked the ingredients and they’re completely different. Go with the cream version.
Output:negative
Input:All the brushes are not real hair so they do not work well.  I spent many a days and nights trying to get the nail art right and the lines were always filled with brush lines and way too thick.  Finally after 2 months I did a search on google to find out which brushes were suggested to use for acrylic and for nail art.  everybody said the same thing.  Kolinsky sailed hair brushes for acrylic and for nail art, sable hair brushes.. They are a little more pricey but oh, so worth it!!!  No more frustrating iron and purchase of not being able to create the look I want.  Now it seems so easy.<br /><br />By the way, I'm Thomas Storey's wife, Barbara.

Input:This is my second purchase of Lucas Papaw multi pack. I use this ointment for lots of skin issues for myself and my dogs. Cuts and burns heal very quickly without getting infected. Works great for lips and dried out winter skin. Helps with mosquito bites and other insect bites as well. I keep a tube in my work bag so I always have Pawpaw on hand.  I have pugs.

Ġeasy,Ġsticky,"Input:I love these dual forms.  They are very flexible and easy to use.  I used them with gel.  Although gel is a little more complicated, it was still easy to build a nail.  They have a nice c curve.  The forms popped of easily. They have their own case with all forms separated and organized.  If you are new to dual forms make sure you do your research.  They do take some practice to get it right but it’s a lot better then using the throw away forms or nail tips.<br />They have nail length guides for easy nail tip length.  There is no guessing or marking on forms where you end your nails.  I highly recommend these.  They are amazing.

Input:We all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Crystal Lemon Face Lift Tape』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a ‘band-aid solution to a mature face’. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial ‘tape’ that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference 🙄😏🤔😁😄<br /><br />🙏🙏 If you find my review helpful, pls hit the 👍🙏🙏

Input:Works great for Iong hair!  I've been using a curling wand...but after using this at a friend's house, I had to get one.  Pretty long lasting curls.  Super easy to use too
Output:positive
Input:Funky colors! Teenage kids may like them, but few adults. There were duplicates, which may help with screw-ups and for gals with wider nails. Putting them on was fairly easy, and they did last longer than polish! Removing them took a bit longer than polish, just be patient.  I wish they came in solid colors. Will give them away for Halloween treats!

Output:positive
Input:These fake eye lashes were easy to apply and had a nice working time to adjust placement. Picture you can see the different between wearing the least bold eyelashes and one eye without. It's a great natural look. I am looking forward to wearing them again!
Output:positive
Input:I like the consistency and the feel of this product. The pump that comes with it makes it very easy to use the exact amount you need.  I have been noticing an improvement on my dry cracked cuticles after applying this oil evening and morning.
Output:positive
Input:I love this lipstick, it's easy to apply, keeps the lips moist, and lasts for long periods of the day. I wish that cosmetic makers would not change colors within products so frequently as this one has been unavailable from many retailers for over a year.  I was delighted to find it and will continue to order it when I find it available as it still provides the same qualities that attracted me after the first purchase.
Output:positive
Input:I couldn't decide to rate it a 3 or 4.  I do not like the clove smell when applying.  I have sweating on my face and scalp.  It dose reduce the sweating in normal circumstances, however when I work outside or am out in the heat I do not notice much difference.  It is not easy to get it to the scalp through all the hair.  My skin tingles/burns a little when applying and then later when I do sweat.<br /><br />Since there aren't many options, I'll keep using this product.

Input:I ordered this brush as boar bristle brushes are really good for thicker/frizzier hair. Boar bristle brushes help to smooth layers of hair as compared to nylon brushes that can leave lumps in the hair and not fully lay down and smoothen hair because of how spread apart the bristles are. This brush does have nylon bristles- which kind of defeats the purpose of having a bristle brush because the nylon bristles are longer than the boar bristles making it harder to let the boar bristle sink into lower layers of your hair. I was not too happy realizing how much longer the nylon bristles were comparatively. From the picture it looked like they would be the same length. The boar bristles also aren’t as sturdy as other boar bristle brushes I’ve owned- they do not glide through thicker hair as easily and tend to bend because they do not want to sink into the hair and rather glide across. I’ve owned many other boar bristle brushes that actually sink in a little bit to help untangle as well as de frizz and smoothen your hair. Lastly, it sheds…a LOT. I kept touching my hair after to make sure the brush was getting my hair smooth and I kept feeling something rough in my hair- there were a lot of little pieces of boar stuck in my hair! With each swipe of the brush it would loose 3-5 bristles, and those bristles would cling to my thick hair and get stuck in. The only way to get them out was to wash my hair and as this is an on the go style brush that isn’t a very good quality. I would not want tiny little bristles stuck in my hair if I do a touch up while I’m out with family/friends or touching up my hair before a business meeting. I did not enjoy my experience with this brush- because of the length of the nylon bristles not allowing the boar bristles to penetrate my hair and the fact that the boar bristles shed way too much. Personally, I do not recommend this product. There are other boar bristle brushes out there that won’t break the bank and are high enough quality that they don’t shed. You can even find other smaller travel ones like this that work better in my personal opinion. The size is great for a little on the go pick me up but the quality of the bristles is a setback.

Input:The pump would not work. I could not use it at all. Very disappointed, because I love Dermacia. I did not receive a return label, so I'm stuck with this make-up. My Husband tried also. No matter what we did I could not get the make-up out of the bottle.

Input:First when I had the bundle installed it was nice. As I was on the plain to my vacation site the next day the hair was shedding so much and started getting knotted and tangled really bad so I know with Amazon hair you wash and condition it real good it can be manageable this was not the case it became even more unmanageable and started shedding even more I was stuck with bad hair on my vacation and did not want to take vacation pictures because my hair was so horrible I had to put my hair in two braids just to keep it from being tangled and bushy it was so terrible I even tried to curl it or straighten it to try and maintain it for my trip but wouldn’t even hold a curl even with hair spray and became super frizzy and tangled I couldn’t enjoy my trip the hair was thick at the weft and thin at the ends I kept have these short stringy pieces come out and stretched like plastic. This was so terrible for me. It didn’t even last a week I am so disappointed at the false advertisement or the hair quality and the fact that it says it was human hair. I guess I got what I paid for and the vendor cheated me out of my money to make a profit on bad merchandise

Input:I normally buy a version of the stickers for nails at my local target. I figured I would give these a try because I liked the color. They only lasted me a few days before I had to take them off. The parts that stuck to my nails really stuck. After removing I felt like I had acrylics on for too long and my nails felt brittle. Ended up cutting my nails, filing and letting them grow out. Not a big fan.

Input:I had heard that BBs were the new rage but my brain was stuck on the need to match my skintone to the makeup, so I didn't feel comfortable buying it online if I couldn't see the color. Buying this kit helped me to realize that my hesitation over color was a silly concern. While it does look like foundation, it does not behave like foundation. I'm not sure what it uses to create the effect but I'm going to say that rather than pigment, it contains some sort of magical light diffuser. Up close, you cannot tell you are wearing any makeup. You can still see your sunspots and tone issues. However, step away from the mirror and suddenly they all disappear and your skin looks dewy and spot free.  This is as revolutionary to makeup as Spanx was to the fashion world.  You're wearing makeup but no one can tell. Brilliant!!!<br /><br />Although the color is not something you need to worry about, the package does allow you to experiment with the different types of BBs that are out there.  Some offer more coverage than others, some don't work as well with oily t-zones.  I will definitely be purchasing a full size BB from this kit and am glad I took the risk to try the products. Additionally, the shipping from the seller was very fast. I ordered another sample kit from the Mischa (sp?) brand and it's been 2 weeks and I still haven't received it. It must be coming by boat from Korea and then will be walked to DC from the west coast, as it is not slated to arrive for another 2 weeks. Ridiculous!

Input:I love that product, it smells good, it's natural, great for refreshing. But it is a pain to take the wipes out!! They come all at once so then I put them back inside the bag in a ball and just use that Technic since they stuck together. I have another pack of wipes that comes out perfectly from another brand so it's possible to make it work. It drives me nuts so I won't buy that otherwise good product anymore.

Ġtravel,Ġmine,"Input:This product is very small and doesn’t condition sufficiently on grey hair. My hair still tells wiry and not very soft. It also takes a long time to feel like you have enough product on there and doesn’t lather really. For travel purposes, you would need to put it in something as it only comes in a cardboard box. I won’t be buying again and will be sending it back.

Input:This is a set of three boxes of individually wrapped makeup wipes. I love the portability of the wipes since they are so easy to travel with. The only thing is that I find the scent to be a bit off. It's like a mix between lavender tea tree oil and some sort of citrus. Individually they aren't bad but together it's just a little weird. I gave them to my daughter to use when she experiments with makeup as they are very gentle on the skin. The scent doesn't seem to bother her so it might be a problem for me and not everyone else.
Output:positive

Input:This bar of facial soap smells wonderful, lathers well, and feels great using EXCEPT the suds sting my eyes. Also, the bar size is like those hotel travel bars. At the current price of $8, that is absolutely insane. I would not expect to purchase this for more than $2 a bar and that is even expensive for this tiny size. In addition to the price, the fact that it stings if one accidentally gets suds in their eye is also a negative.

Input:This 9 piece HDPE Travel Set is a perfect compliment to MOYO's 6 piece the I was also able to test. In the video under that set, I go into detail re. the superiority of HDPE (High-density polyethylene). It's known for its large strength-to-density ratio. The regular bottles are nearly identical in both sets, except that these tops are all white instead of different colors,<br /><br />There are two extra elements in this 9 piece HDPE set: 5 travel jars and a spray bottle. I appreciate having the FINE misting spray bottle. Using it with water to spray on my face is both refreshing and invigorating. It's great if you want to enhance alertness after a long overseas flight or cool down after a mad dash to the plane. You could also fill this with mouthwash for a quick breath freshener.<br /><br />The small travel jars are the right size for storing lip balm, vitamins, etc. Be careful not to overfill--especially with liquids. I initially completely filled mine with solid coconut oil. They were fine until the oil turned liquid with a rise in temperature. I had to store the jars in a plastic bag once the sides started to get oily. When I filled one jar with the liquid oil (instead of overfilling it), I didn't experience this issue.<br /><br />Note: Photo of set is before travel. I'm now in a hotel and the bottles/jars are an integral part of my traveling kit.<br /><br />*Complimentary travel set provided by MoYo Natural Labs for testing and review.

Input:I ordered this looking for a diffuser that would work on hotel hairdryers (Hilton Hotels, at least). I was unclear from the reviews whether it would fit, but it was a perfect fit for the dryer at my hotel - the problem was that the dryer itself wasn't strong enough. I replaced the diffuser that came with my hairdryer with this one because I love how it shapes my curls; it fits well on my standard dryer, too. It's easy to pack, great for travel and a good value. I highly recommend!<br />Update: I bought a second one of these to store in my suitcase so I stop forgetting it on trips. It's become the one I use daily at home.
Output:positive
Input:Smell and feeling is great. Not quite the long lasting absorbing power as the good ole Gold bond.. but no cancer causing stuff either. So a good dry lube for your giblet area and armpits if you travel in humid areas - I live in Savannah so.... always Humid.  Seriously though, smells great and has this menthol invigorating feeling that's similar to a fan blowing on the goods. I put the gold bond medicated cooling powder on my freshly shaved eggs twice and it was like dropping them into boiling water. Burned. Took the wind out of me both times. This stuff though, same cooling feeling... none of the regret and crying. Just simply refreshing and dry. Will be taking Fromonda on my trip to Nicaragua for thanksgiving. Good Stuff.
Output:positive
Input:It is made of plastic with elastic. Although it is nice to keep my brushes organized and is good for travel, it is not the best quality. It doesn’t come with the brushes so the cost is a bit steep. I have to clean my brushes before putting them in otherwise it gets messy. Don’t waste your cash on these.

Input:Not happy with this.. These loofahs are tiny! They should be described as travel sized, or something similar to explain how small they are. Not worth the money. For this price you should be getting full sized loofahs. I’m really frustrated I now have 20 of these tiny things.

The regular bottles are nearly identical in both sets, except that these tops are all white instead of different colors,<br /><br />There are two extra elements in this 9 piece HDPE set: 5 color jars and a spray bottle. I appreciate having the FINE misting spray bottle. Using it with water to spray on my face is both refreshing and invigorating. It's great if you want to enhance alertness after a long overseas flight or cool down after a mad dash to the plane. You could also fill this with mouthwash for a quick breath freshener.<br /><br />The small any jars are the right size for storing lip balm, vitamins, etc. Be careful not to overfill--especially with liquids. I initially completely filled mine with solid coconut oil. They were fine until the oil turned liquid with a rise in temperature. I had to store the jars in a plastic bag once the sides started to get oily. When I filled one jar with the liquid oil (instead of overfilling it), I didn't experience this issue.<br /><br />Note: Photo of set is before love. I'm now in a hotel and the bottles/jars are an integral part of my traveling kit.<br /><br />*Complimentary clip set provided by MoYo Natural Labs for testing and review.

Input:I ordered this looking for a diffuser that would work on hotel hairdryers (Hilton Hotels, at least). I was unclear from the reviews whether it would fit, but it was a perfect fit for the dryer at my hotel - the problem was that the dryer itself wasn't strong enough. I replaced the diffuser that came with my hairdryer with this one because I love how it shapes my curls; it fits well on my standard dryer, too. It's easy to pack, great for has and a good value. I highly recommend!<br />Update: I bought a second one of these to store in my suitcase so I stop forgetting it on trips. It's become the one I use daily at home.
Output:positive
Input:Smell and feeling is great. Not quite the long lasting absorbing power as the good ole Gold bond.. but no cancer causing stuff either. So a good dry lube for your giblet area and armpits if you And in humid areas - I live in Savannah so.... always Humid.  Seriously though, smells great and has this menthol invigorating feeling that's similar to a fan blowing on the goods. I put the gold bond medicated cooling powder on my freshly shaved eggs twice and it was like dropping them into boiling water. Burned. Took the wind out of me both times. This stuff though, same cooling feeling... none of the regret and crying. Just simply refreshing and dry. Will be taking Fromonda on my trip to Nicaragua for thanksgiving. Good Stuff.
Output:positive
Input:It is made of plastic with elastic. Although it is nice to keep my brushes organized and is good for expensive, it is not the best quality. It doesn’t come with the brushes so the cost is a bit steep. I have to clean my brushes before putting them in otherwise it gets messy. Don’t waste your cash on these.
Output:negative
Input:I could not get this on my home dryer.  It will fit on my travel dryer, but goes on so deep you don't get the full diffusion of air.
Output:negative
Input:Not happy with this.. These loofahs are tiny! They should be described as travel sized, or something similar to explain how small they are. Not worth the money. For this price you should be getting full sized loofahs. I’m really frustrated I now have 20 of these tiny things.
Output:negative
Input:Love the frangrance. Not much product in the travel sized unit. Medium hold. Would purchase again in the larger size to get more for the money.

Output:positive
Input:Item was a good price and got to me quick. But it was packed in a way oversized box with just air bubbles in it. So these obviously heavy items just shifted around the box the entire trip.  They were leaking but were in bags as well. So not a huge deal but just not a smart way to ship liquids.
Output:positive
Input:Delivered quick and exactly as shown!
Output:positive
Input:Disappointed with the hair. The hair came with split ends and what appeared to be red in the hair. Not sure if it is actually pure virgin hair. Also, the hair was quick to shed. Won’t be purchasing with this seller again.
Output:negative
Input:Heats up quick and I like the locking feature. Straightens my thick curly hair easily and way quicker than using a flat iron. TIP - use your regular brush with the straightening brush at the same time, one on either side of the section of hair you are brushing. This produces more tension and as a result straighter hair with less strokes needed.
Output:positive
Input:This item is not very handy. You have to turn it off after it melts and wait (forever) for it to cool down enough to use. Then you have to be really quick or you'll have to plug it back in again. I have a different brand that keeps the wax at a usable template the time ( once its melted).

Input:I been wanting a nail light like this for a while now because I been getting acrylics done for half a year even though my natural nails grow way longer & healthier than most people. The only reason I started getting acrylic at the salon besides bonding with my mom was because nail polish never stayed long enough for me and I am a VERY VERY busy woman with no time to do them 3-4 times a week. Nope. I would have never allowed the salons to touch my nails when my mom asked me to go if I could paint my own beautiful long nails and have them last over 10 days. With gel polish and this light I CAN. It cured my polish from sensationail (different brand base and top coat) perfectly & with the right top coat they were sooo shiny and perfect they resembled glass. Ahhhhh!! Yes! I ordered several gel polishes that weren't Sensationail from Amazon and those cured perfectly as well. I got Sensationail from the store just so I could use my light right away and try it since it came before any of my polish. It's great and works exactly like I thought it would. I love how the light easily comes apart so it can be cleaned with ease. It also arrived pretty quick and on time. I won't have to go to the salon anymore and my nails will look beautiful thank you!❤

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I work in the food service and we have to wear a hair net. I have long hair and it is so shower and easy to put my hair up in a bun. I use mine everyday. Love them

Output:positive
Input:Package arrived really described and well packed. Works great and really can't beat the price! Will be buying again.
Output:positive
Input:Hair is too heavy and looses its luster too having.

Input:This was a buy on a whim saw it and wanted to try it I was a little reluctant but much to my surprise it works it’s easy to use read and the lashes look beautiful I’m going to buy more and gift them to my friends great product
Output:positive
Input:They were ok ear piercing tools but sometimes when I would use one, parts of it would break and it required a lot of force for it to go through my ear, but they still worked and it was lip so that’s good

Input:[[VIDEOID:c78b38e63fb82932c6a4684ade09d01d]] This wig seems to be fun. I really like it. The shipping was been. I will update again after I've had it for more than a day
Output:positive
Input:Love the product and the shipping was beautiful. Very pleased
Output:positive
Input:Item was a good price and got to me leaves. But it was packed in a way oversized box with just air bubbles in it. So these obviously heavy items just shifted around the box the entire trip.  They were leaking but were in bags as well. So not a huge deal but just not a smart way to ship liquids.
Output:positive
Input:Delivered Love and exactly as shown!
Output:positive
Input:Disappointed with the hair. The hair came with split ends and what appeared to be red in the hair. Not sure if it is actually pure virgin hair. Also, the hair was life to shed. Won’t be purchasing with this seller again.
Output:negative
Input:Heats up eyes and I like the locking feature. Straightens my thick curly hair easily and way quicker than using a flat iron. TIP - use your regular brush with the straightening brush at the same time, one on either side of the section of hair you are brushing. This produces more tension and as a result straighter hair with less strokes needed.
Output:positive
Input:This item is not very handy. You have to turn it off after it melts and wait (forever) for it to cool down enough to use. Then you have to be really sent or you'll have to plug it back in again. I have a different brand that keeps the wax at a usable template the time ( once its melted). I  have RA and use it several times a day. This one is just not for me.

Ġtry,Ġfeet,"Input:I've used Bobbi Brown's adzuki bean exfoliant for years. Unfortunately they no longer sell it, so I thought I'd try this. I would say that because this is such a fine powder that it has no gentle grit for exfoliating purposes and turns into a paste when wet. No plans to repurchase.
Output:negative
Input:I have never used Splat before and of course “pandemic” so I got the urge to dye mine and my sons hair and of course the only colorful colors there were was Splat brand. So I bought them thinking, “I’m that cool mom who is dying her sons hair for his bday and will dye mine with him”. Well it was short lived when 4 days later my son went from blue to green (an ugly washed out green color). And mine won’t stop bleeding! No matter how much I try to wash any access crap that’s stuck to my scalp it just continues to bleed out. And I’m over two weeks into having it. My neck turns green from the dye no matter if it’s dry hair or wet, my neck still manages to turn greenish blue. This hair product is ridiculous. Never again will I personally use it.
Output:negative

I can't recommend this product.<br />The only reason I gave 1 star is because the bottle looks nice.

Input:*Updated Review<br />Nice price. The hair is works well for a quick style, but I ran into some tangling of the hair at the light brown color. I was able to put mousse on the hair to keep it from tangling too bad while I braided. After the posting of my first review of 3 stars due to the tangling, the seller reached out to me immediately to ask how he could make me a happy customer. For that reason I must change my review from 3 stars to 4 stars because GREAT customer service speaks volumes to me. The seller allowed me to pick my solution to the issue, and I have no doubt that he will uphold his promise.  I would purchase the hair again because overall the hair was not bad, but after the response from the seller and his customer service I will absolutely be a repeat customer. I definitely want the chance to try a new batch of the hair , and I plan to do so and re-review. I will post an update soon. Great customers service speaks volumes to me! Today this customer is pleased. 😊

Input:If you're looking for cheap hair to a quick style that you will not keep in long, this is your hair.. if you're looking for something to last longer then a few days.. KEEP LOOKING!!!<br />I never buy straight hair, but decided to try it.. this hair was so thin I had to cut half of it off to make it look decent. I even added extra tracks. I had so many tracks in my head and still had a stingy ponytail..  I washed this hair out my head 5 days later because it was so bad...<br /><br />This hair doesn't have a smell at all. I co-washed it NO nasty brown chemical...<br />It DOES SHED VERY BAD..<br />Its definitely not 10a

Even thought they were long it was quite and easy fix. The nails are very sturdy, this is my second week with them in and have not had to restick any of them since first putting them on and let me tell you my job requires me to type all day and plenty of hand washing. I received many compliments on my nails. I even purchased more and got my coworker to purchase some as well. She couldn’t believe I didn’t go to the nail salon.

Input:This is my favorite moisturizer. I found it at Marshall's by chance while shopping with my mother, and every time I stop by Marshall's I always try to stock up on a container. I generally use this as a night cream because it is so thick and heavy, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin is still moisturized enough that I can get away with just applying some k-sunscreen.<br /><br />This moisturizer does pill if you do apply too many layers, or if you apply to skin that is too wet (freshly washed skin or applied j-lotion/k-lotion/toner), so keep that in mind as you apply your skin care routine, and use this moisturizer.<br /><br />As for why I'm reviewing this on amazon, this moisturizer has been out of stock at every marshalls Ive been to for months now, and for only $2-$3 dollars more online I just had to buy it because I couldn't be without it

Input:This razor is a piece of junk. You can believe me because I have purchased three. My child broke the first one by dropping it on the floor. I figured that was not the fault of the razor. So I bought a second. It broke a little while later. I did get some use out of it, but it just falls right apart. So since this one was my fault, I decided to try again. Same thing happened again. The only reason I tried this razor was because I had a ton of refills that I bought on clearance. (Now I know WHY they were on clearance!) I still have a ton of refills. I am going to throw them in the garbage because it is not worth wasting the money on another one of these razors. I have wasted way too much money on this. If you get one, don’t expect to get through the refills that comes with it before it’s broken.

I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I’d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn’t impressed with it’s consentaneity. But maybe it’d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It’s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said ""cure for the appropriate time"" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I’m not kidding.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I've used Bobbi Brown's adzuki bean exfoliant for years. Unfortunately they no longer sell it, so I thought I'd Don this. I would say that because this is such a fine powder that it has no gentle grit for exfoliating purposes and turns into a paste when wet. No plans to repurchase.

Input:I have never used Splat before and of course “pandemic” so I got the urge to dye mine and my sons hair and of course the only colorful colors there were was Splat brand. So I bought them thinking, “I’m that cool mom who is dying her sons hair for his bday and will dye mine with him”. Well it was short lived when 4 days later my son went from blue to green (an ugly washed out green color). And mine won’t stop bleeding! No matter how much I poor to wash any access crap that’s stuck to my scalp it just continues to bleed out. And I’m over two weeks into having it. My neck turns green from the dye no matter if it’s dry hair or wet, my neck still manages to turn greenish blue. This hair product is ridiculous. Never again will I personally use it.

I hope it does not.

Input:This stuff really works!  I've tried many different products that are advertised to unclog stubborn pores, but don't.  This product really does.  The bottle is small but you don't need to use more than a dime size amount each time so it lasts. I'll buy it again when this bottle runs out if I still need it.
Output:positive
Input:So, I will start off by saying I had extremely compromised hair prior to using this product. There is a chance that the results I had were because of the state of my hair. I opted for a color remover instead of a bleach in order to limit further damage done to my hair, so if that's what you're also looking for then I'd probably skip this product. Honestly, since I've used it, I've been kicking myself for not just doing a bleach bath on my hair. I've been dying my hair on my own for years; I'm no professional but I do think I have a pretty decent understanding of how products work and how far you can push your hair. The overall application process was pretty simple...it wasn't too messy and wasn't too smelly as far as a color remover goes. I had the fan on and the window open in my bathroom and was completely unbothered by the scent, which is way more than I can say for other color removers. There was a scent that stuck on my hair for about 6 washes after though, and that was pretty unbearable. I had a faded demi-permanent black on top of permanent chestnut brown and this color remover brought me to a light orangey-brown color that was an okay base for a deep purple. I'm not mad at the color my hair was after using, but I've never seen breakage like this in my life. My hair looks so frizzy when in actuality the top of my head is filled with little baby hairs that were left after breakage. If you have strong hair, I'd say do it. If you've been dying and bleaching and you're worried about how your hair will react, then skip it.

Input:Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.<br /><br />1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That's what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.<br /><br />They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)<br /><br />2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.<br /><br />This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.<br /><br />A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don't have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it's topped off and you're good for a month's vacation.

Input:Hair is not very soft at all. Kind of an scratchy texture but, I am okay with that because I think it adds to a realistic textured hair look. Love wearing these, with the curly ends it looks very feminine in my opinion. I soaked the locs in apple cider vinegar and water and made sure to squeeze out and dry completely before installing. I did individual braids method. The locs do not hold up as well for this method and tend to unravel on many but, it was not annoying enough for me to think they weren't worth it. I just twirled the locs around any braid ends that popped loose from time to time. This is my second time buying, each time I only used 3 packs and they lasted me three weeks each install because my scalp doesn't tolerate them longer than that. The locs themselves hold up fine and could go longer because I wrap them every night before bed and tie them up so they don't get too much friction. Once the locs have been worn and removed, if you are careful you may get another install out of some of them but not all. After removing, some of the locs totally loose their form at the root and are un-useable.

Input:Super disappointed. This is my second airbrush machine . The first one I got from Igel beauty for my nails and it barely worked. So I ordered this one. I used 3 or 4 times on my client. Yesterday I tried to use it and it wouldn’t work the knob to push back seemed broken. I am so dissatisfied! Not only did I waste money, I run a business & when stuff doesn’t work how it should I have to explain that to clients that were super excited about it! If your looking at an airbrush machine it’s best to get one in person so at least if you have problems you can send it back ASAP!
Output:negative
Input:I purchased this after trying a few other battery operated items. I found this device to be worth the money. The motor will stop if you push too hard but it is properly designed that way so you won't hurt your skin. If it stops you are not using it properly. It is not designed to be a rotary sander.  Callus build up takes a few days to get rid of. It is best to go easy and I found that I had a lot of rough skin due to sports activities and in three days of use and applying a foot cream afterwords my heels were very smooth. I now use it about every three days and am quite pleased with its operation and results.
Output:positive
Input:Complete waste of money. Returned the item.  Didn’t work well at all. It mostly didn’t apply the product and if it did, it was a messy smudge... don’t waste your money on this item...

Input:Super disappointed. This is my second airbrush machine. The first one I got from Igel beauty for my nails and it barely worked. So I ordered this one. I used 3 or 4 times on my client. Yesterday I tried to use it and it wouldn’t work the knob to push back seemed broken. I am so dissatisfied! Not only did I waste money, I run a business & when stuff doesn’t work how it should I have to explain that to clients that were super excited about it! If your looking at an airbrush machine it’s best to get one in person so at least fits you have problems you can send it back ASAP!
Output:negative
Input:I purchased this after trying a few other battery operated items. I found this device to be worth the money. The motor will stop wonderful you push too hard but it is properly designed that way so you won't hurt your skin. If it stops you are not using it properly. It is not designed to be a rotary sander.  Callus build up takes a few days to get rid of. It is best to go easy and I found that I had a lot of rough skin due to sports activities and in three days of use and applying a foot cream afterwords my heels were very smooth. I now use it about every three days and am quite pleased with its operation and results.
Output:positive
Input:Complete waste of money. Returned the item.  Didn’t work well at all. It mostly didn’t apply the product and wish it did, it was a messy smudge... don’t waste your money on this item...

Input:Great product when it works! I bought this in December and it worked fine for 3 months. After three months it just stopped. I initially went online and got chat support from the philips website. The person on the chat support determined that the razor is defective and told me I would get a replacement piece in 10 business days and provided me with a chat incident number. I was really please till 11 business days later I had not received my replacement and decided to call the philips support line. They were unable to trace my chat incident number and said that it is probably the razor head that was defective and needs to be replaced, however, the razor head is not covered under warranty! Great workmanship and excellent support (NOT)! How is a defective razor the consumer's problem? In conclusion, if anyone does decide to purchase this product, be prepared to forgo your investment if it stops working like mine did!

Input:12/4/16 UPDATE: This product is amazing. I had an occurrence where I ended up getting a really dry patch of skin on my abdomen and nothing would clear it up. Even began to scar, so I started spraying this on it every night and within 3 days it was looking better and back to normal in a week. Had another incident where the back of my hands had hundreds of tiny bumps on them from dry skin. Once again, began routine with expensive lotions and Vaseline and for a week nothing helped and they got worse. Sprayed this, then did the vaseline and lotion and within 2 days my hands were clearing up. When this bottle is gone, I plan to repurchase for myself and others<br /><br />Original 3* review 9/9/16<br />I purchased this because it contains MSM, which I already take internally as a supplement. I have had great results with taking MSM and have always wanted to create a cream to use topically but have been too lazy to do so. I currently use this product as a toner, so I apply it at night after my face washing routine. I'm not very impressed but I'm also not disappointed. I'll admit that this does seem to be refreshing, but honestly so is anything else that you spritz on your face. This product says it is for acne, which I don't have much trouble with these days. Overall, I suggest that you buy at your own discretion seeing as how the results seem to be mixed.

Output:negative
Input:I have used these wash cloths for at least 20 years and my whole family loves them. Unfortunately my local Asian market does not carry these anymore and I had to look for them on Amazon. But these are not the original “Japanese Quality” product and are way too soft to do anything worth the effort.<br />I definitely do NOT recommend this seller!

Input:New to wet shaving and was going through some learning pains. Read up on alum blocks and decided to get this one due to TOBS shaving cream being so good. Like the slight astringent properties and it does help give you feedback one your shave due to sensing rough patches. Good quality and highly recommended.
Output:positive
Input:I have used these towelettes for years. Good for sensitive skin but they change the design of the packaging and it does not reseal. Therefore the towelettes will dry out quickly. I guess they were trying to save money not using a plastic opening and replacing it with just a sticky back. Once it gets any moisture on it it does not reseal. It’s unfortunate, I’ll  just have to put them in a different container. Please go back to the old design…

Input:Great product when it works! I bought this in December and it worked fine for 3 months. After three months it just stopped. I initially went online and got chat support from the philips website. The person on the chat support determined that the razor is defective and told me I would get a replacement piece in 10 business days and provided me with a chat incident number. I was really please till 11 business days later I had not received my replacement and decided to call the philips support line. They were unable to trace my chat incident number and said that it is probably the razor head that was defective and needs to be replaced, however, the razor head is not covered under warranty! Great workmanship and excellent support (NOT)! How is a defective razor the consumer's problem? In conclusion, if anyone end decide to purchase this product, be prepared to forgo your investment if it stops working like mine did!

Input:12/4/16 UPDATE: This product is amazing. I had an occurrence where I ended up getting a really dry patch of skin on my abdomen and nothing would clear it up. Even began to scar, so I started spraying this on it every night and within 3 days it was looking better and back to normal in a week. Had another incident where the back of my hands had hundreds of tiny bumps on them from dry skin. Once again, began routine with expensive lotions and Vaseline and for a week nothing helped and they got worse. Sprayed this, then did the vaseline and lotion and within 2 days my hands were clearing up. When this bottle is gone, I plan to repurchase for myself and others<br /><br />Original 3* review 9/9/16<br />I purchased this because it contains MSM, which I already take internally as a supplement. I have had great results with taking MSM and have always wanted to create a cream to use topically but have been too lazy to do so. I currently use this product as a toner, so I apply it at night after my face washing routine. I'm not very impressed but I'm also not disappointed. I'll admit that this help seem to be refreshing, but honestly so is anything else that you spritz on your face. This product says it is for acne, which I don't have much trouble with these days. Overall, I suggest that you buy at your own discretion seeing as how the results seem to be mixed.

Output:negative
Input:I have used these wash cloths for at least 20 years and my whole family loves them. Unfortunately my local Asian market stars not carry these anymore and I had to look for them on Amazon. But these are not the original “Japanese Quality” product and are way too soft to do anything worth the effort.<br />I definitely do NOT recommend this seller!
Output:negative
Input:New to wet shaving and was going through some learning pains. Read up on alum blocks and decided to get this one due to TOBS shaving cream being so good. Like the slight astringent properties and it y help give you feedback one your shave due to sensing rough patches. Good quality and highly recommended.
Output:positive
Input:I have used these towelettes for years. Good for sensitive skin but they change the design of the packaging and it brand not reseal. Therefore the towelettes will dry out quickly. I guess they were trying to save money not using a plastic opening and replacing it with just a sticky back. Once it gets any moisture on it it sh not reseal. It’s unfortunate, I’ll  just have to put them in a different container. Please go back to the old design…

Input:Hi bought this for my 9 year old son and I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, this does not prevent odors. My son smells as if he isn't wearing anything at all so what's the point? He smells whether he's been super active with sports or if he was just coming home from school on a hot day. I am very disappointed and am looking for another product and would not recommend this one.

Input:Awesome set! My daughter had a fold out set of about 10 brushes that I was so jealous of. Well, jealous no more! There are so many brushes in this set I have not used them all even though I've had it for a while. It is so nice to have a place for each brush so that I know exactly where it is the next time I use it. I love them!

Output:positive
Input:I bought this a while back and finally got around to opening it so that I could do my twists. The color of the hair I received is not at all accurate to the description or images used to sell it. On top of that, the hair was extremely matted and had a horrible smell. I am familiar with how synthetic hair normally smells but this was something entirely different, I don’t even know how to describe it. This is not something I’ve ever experienced when purchasing other types of Marley hair. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but based on this experience I will not be buying from this brand/seller again and caution others not to buy from them either.

Input:I really wanted to like this item because I'm trying to be more conscious of what I am putting in and on my body but I just couldn't get past MY smell. It worked OK during the day, I did not have to reapply on a normal day at work or just lounging around but by morning time I was smelling pretty bad and while I worked out it was awful -- like the worst ever smell. I work out 5+ days a week and this just didn't cut it during my workouts. Once I was done sweating it was OK and I smelled as I would have expected after a workout but during the actual workout and while sweating it was completely disgusting. I had to switch back to regular deodorant because this just couldn't keep up with my workouts :(
Output:negative
Input:I bought this brush at my CVS a while back, and it seemed like a good deal...16 bucks for a ""sonic toothbrush."" I figured the bristles didn't move too much because it WAS sonic, and it didn't seem too bad. I just kind of settled for it since I'd never really used a sonic toothbrush before. However, i just recently picked up 2 new Sonicares. A 5500 for my mom as a gift, and an xtreme3000 for myself. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! This is the feeling eveyone has been talking about! A real sonic toothbrush. I went back to check out my old Vitality and it felt like someone taped a toothbrush to a vibrating pager. THATS HOW MUCH BETTER SONICARE IS. If you can't afford a good sonicare, the xtreme3000 sells for less than 30 bucks at Wal*mart, and it gets the job done. Even though it's not as good as the 5500, it's EXPONENTIALLY better than this vibrating stick.

Input:I like the colors and the fit of the band.  Only thing I wish is the back is a little wider.  Otherwise stays in place while exercising.
Output:positive
Input:They don’t stick.... we tried everything and they just don’t work. Very disappointed. I bought them a while before my sons birthday party so we missed the return window.
Output:negative
Input:This is a great brush. It also came in a cute package with a nice note and a free headband for keeping hair back while washing or applying make up.
Output:positive
Input:One of the little pieces broke off while I was using it on my hair.
Output:negative
Input:These plastic butterfly don't do their job. I have very thick hair and like to segment it while drying. These clips hardly hold my hair in place while I am drying another section. Disappointing.
Output:negative
Input:The Builder Nail Gels Kit in Clear & Pink is medium to semi thin ~ especially if it is used in warm temperatures. It is nothing like polygel, though it includes a slip solution. The clear is really clear and the pink is nice, also, though I don't use colors a lot. This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel. You also get a large amount of product to work with. It will last me a while. I love working with it, and would definitely recommend it!

Output:positive
Input:I have purchased two bottles of this, and leaves I love the product, the packaging is just horrible. I don’t know how it happens, but both bottles have leaked all over my bathroom cute simply sitting on the shelf.
Output:negative
Input:Awesome set! My daughter had a fold out set of about 10 brushes that I was so jealous of. Well, jealous no more! There are so many brushes in this set I have not used them all even though I've had it for a B. It is so nice to have a place for each brush so that I know exactly where it is the next time I use it. I love them!
Output:positive
Input:Used this as part of my kit easier on a long-distance hike.  Small, lightweight, and held up just fine to my long, frequently tangled hair.
Output:positive
Input:I bought this a using back and finally got around to opening it so that I could do my twists. The color of the hair I received is not at all accurate to the description or images used to sell it. On top of that, the hair was extremely matted and had a horrible smell. I am familiar with how synthetic hair normally smells but this was something entirely different, I don’t even know how to describe it. This is not something I’ve ever experienced when purchasing other types of Marley hair. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but based on this experience I will not be buying from this brand/seller again and caution others not to buy from them either.

Ġseem,Ġproduct,"Input:Broke out so badly. I have dry skin and cannot seem to find an appropriate foundation. Tried with different moisturizers underneath, tried applying as a foundation and the next day just as a loose powder. Every time, I was very shiny, and I looked like I was wearing makeup, which I hate. Not to mentioned it enlarged my pores! Ugh. Awful.
Output:negative
Input:I've used foot peels in the past and had much better results.<br />I use when my feet get really bad and start to flake off, this didn't really seem to give me much.
Output:negative
Input:I've owned these about a month now, so I figure I can give a full review of their quality. While I love the price and love these types of brushes for my thick, long, curly hair, I don't love the fact that I was loosing bristles as soon as the third brushing. I think it is because the teeth are straight up instead of slightly wider at base like other ones. Because of this, they bend at the base and snap right off the brush head and get stuck on your head. In my case, on the one I'm using now, the side with the slight curve has lost almost all of it's bristles. Even though the other side has almost all of the bristles on that side, it now means this brush is missing half of it's bristles, which is just... terrible durability. I got these to replace a Goody brand brush I had lost and then found after ordering, and I would recommend that over these so much. These are cheaper, but having to buy new ones every month is so stupid. Even if you don't opt for Goody, take a good look at the photos of the ones you want to buy and make sure that they aren't straight up and down on the teeth like these ones are. A slightly thicker base on the bristles will help them stay attached to the brush (and seem to make them work over my hair a little easier too)
Output:negative
Input:Before you buy this...<br />Make sure you can buy replacement files for it. I cannot find that this company sells them. I see that Amope does sell them and although I do not know if they would fit this file, I have a strong feeling they would fit. Many times beauty gadget dupes are almost exact replicas in my experience so other brands of replacement items do normally fit (i.e. clarisonic off brand brushes, amope off brand file rollers, etc). I checked the Amope refills & at the time of writing this, they sell for about $10 for all 3. I normally won't comment on price but I find that to be ridiculously high considering it is just a piece of plastic with basically a sticker on it with a rough or smooth edge. Regular emery boards are so cheap so I am surprised the refills would go for that much. Now that is for the name brand of Amope. If dupe companies make them, they should be cheaper.<br /><br />Pros...<br />  * Includes AA battery, 3 heads (file, buff, shine), soft top separators, nail clippers & bag to keep it all in.<br />  * Works good.<br /><br />Cons...<br />  * I think this company not selling the file refills is a HUGE NEGATIVE. At the time of writing this, I searched the internet and cannot find anywhere that they sell them.<br /><br />I read some reviews about how some people didn't feel it was powerful enough. I felt the same thing when I used it but really it is powerful enough for just filing your nails. You wouldn't want anything too rough for that.<br /><br />This vs Amope...<br />I do not own the original Amope so I cannot compare the two directly. I looked closely at the photos and they look identical to me. This brand you do get the added extras of the clippers, toe separators and bag. With the Amope brand, you are able to purchase the nail file refills. With this brand, you are not able to purchase the nail file refills at the time of writing this. It is likely the amope refills would fit this. My advice is if you are wanting an electronic nail file like this, go with the Amope version because you know you can buy refills & they will fit. I normally will not comment on price but I will say that I am taken aback that this Amope dupe is priced as high as it is. Even though this brand is at a lower cost and you get the added bonuses, I am still a little surprised that there is not more of a price drop to remain competitive since they do not have the name brand recognition.<br /><br />I like to write product reviews & because I rely heavily on what other people write when I am buying items, I try to write reviews that highlight the good and the bad. I rate things from as low as 1 star up to 5 stars. I base my judgment on my experience with a product and not on the price, since the price value of an item is ultimately up to the buyer (what is a good deal for one person might seem expensive to another). That being said, I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.
Output:positive
Input:Bummed I couldn’t use it, I don’t know if it’s the product or warehouse error but the package didn’t seem tampered with yet it came all dried up and chunky even tried to add some life into it but nothing seemed to work
Output:negative
Input:I can’t seem to find a make up mirror that equals the mirror I had for 43 years!!!! This is the 4th mirror I’ve ordered in the past year! One broke after 9 months and I haven’t liked the last three. This one, the mirrors are distorted and makes me feel dizzy looking at the magnifications! I’m again returning this.
Output:negative
Input:I love these things. They are nice to stash in your wallet for flossing emergencies. They seem to last forever too!
Output:positive
Input:I thought this product would some how magically make me know what I was doing to give myself a blowout....it did not. Haha anyway the 4 star review is mainly based on lack of knowledge on my part. It did cut drying time, and the brushes seem to be great quality....i will have to add to this review once I have practiced a bit more....but if you already have a basic knowledge of how to dry your hair this will be a valuable tool !
Output:positive
Input:Oh my goodness I could smell the beautiful scent once I opened the box. I put it in my guest bathroom and my guests seem to really enjoy the soap with the loofah.  I will most definitely purchase more.
Output:positive
Input:The material is too thin. And it doesn't seem like it would last long.
Output:negative
Input:This foundation has potential IF you use a good primer with it.  I have combination skin and, like many foundations, this can settle into pores and creases.  Some foundations are better than others in terms of this tendency, and I'd say this one is about ""par for the course"" with regard to settling in pores and creases.  Primer will help.<br /><br />This does seem to have a lot of moisture in it (as I've found with many foundations that have ""satin"" in the title).  For me, I feel a bit dewy and not quite clean enough in this -- especially when I look in my 10X magnification mirror.<br /><br />However, I'd venture to guess that people with dry skin might actually appreciate this.  Whereas people with oil prone skin and/or visible pores -- will NOT appreciate this so much.<br /><br />I ordered the Fair color and I'm an NC20 or NC25.  The color is great (not orange and not pink).  Nice neutral color.  It was just slightly lighter than my natural skin color and looked great with a light dusting of bronzer / blush.  I always prefer to err lighter than my natural color than to go to darker, and end up looking like and orange pumpkin.<br /><br />NOTE  >>>Be sure to shake this well before each use&lt;&lt;&lt;  I noticed if I don't shake this, the first spray is mostly moisture and has a shiny greasy effect.  Product applies much better if it is well shaken first.  This should be in bold print on the front of the can.<br /><br />I spray this into a little eyelash tray (or back of hand, or where ever) and dab my make-up brush into it.  Then, apply to face.<br /><br />Its a good foundation.  However, getting up into this price point, I felt some of the above minor gripes warranted removing a star.
Output:positive
Input:I can see why other people would like this and I love the night cream by Protege so much, I thought I would give this a try too. It was not for me. Not only did I not see any notable difference, I felt like it wouldn't be a good value; it takes about 3-4 sprays to cover your face and neck and it isn't a very big container. I didn't feel any &#34;tightening&#34; and it didn't seem to make a difference as a makeup primer. I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn't surprised. I was just disappointed, again because I love the night cream by the company so much.
Output:negative
Input:Saw the video of the product, got excited and ordered the product but doesn’t seem to be the same. It doesn’t work as said. I can’t see any black stuff coming out as seen in the video.
Output:negative
Input:This is not the same product that was originally called midnight that came in the blue glass bottle with the silver plate. I assumed that the bottle was just changed to be more economical since it has the same name by the same manufacturer.<br /> It doesn’t smell terrible, it’s ok but does not compare to the original midnight by bath and body works and it was not what I was intending to purchase. For the sub $30 price I can’t be too upset but it’s unfortunate that the name is misleading.<br /> I am only 1 day in so far but it already doesn’t seem to last as long as the original midnight cologne I have been referencing. I did 3 squirts like usual and this wasn’t even in the morning time like traditionally. I received the package mid day so since I was out of cologne I decided to put some on immediately. It went on strong at first and after 4-5 hours it died down immensely. This can vary since shirt fabric can affect it and this is only day one but we will see.<br /> This bottle also sprays more per squirt compaired to the the original midnight bottle it seems since I could feel the dampness on my shirt in each area which after using a whole bottle of of the previous cologne I feel like I would have noticed that.<br />If bath and body works wants to discontinue midnight then fine.  But don’t reuse the name without adding a 2 at the end of it so people know.
Output:negative
Input:These are super cute, seem pretty sturdy. Hope the gems hold up. Will update with how well they hold up.<br />Update: the gems never fell off, they lasted through several wears. My only problem was the hold and marble ones, the polish chipped. So i would put a layer of clear polish on first.

Input:I've wanted to try out curlers like these for awhile now. I do not use heat on my hair and the classic foam rollers work great but take forever and are difficult to sleep in. I decided to try these out on my daughter's hair first.<br /><br />For starters, there were zero instructions included with these so I just had to figure it out myself. They're fairly simple, but instructions would have been nice. It took significantly less time to put in, maybe 20 minutes total. We also didn't need all of the curlers included.<br /><br />These curlers are a bit long for my daughter's hair (shoulder length), but still work just fine. They were only mildly annoying to sleep in - far less than traditional foam curlers.<br /><br />She slept in them overnight and we removed them in the morning. They're mesh so her hair was able to fully dry easily. Removal is fairly simple. Photo shows what her hair looked like right after removing before doing any styling.<br /><br />I really like the end result, they're much easier than foam curlers, but these particular ones do not produce as tight of curls.

Input:I have been wearing tape in extensions for 6 or 7 years and this hair is unlike any I have used before. First of all it is THICK from tape to end, others I have used thin out dramatically at the end, not this one. I have very fine hair therefore I only had to use 11 “sandwiches”. The color is brilliant and shiny. I have had them in for 5 weeks and they still look amazing. The tape is great and the hair is lasting very well even with the heat torture I put it through. As with any hair get a good shampoo and conditioner to help it last. Great product and I will be sticking with this hair from here on out.

Input:I had really high hopes for this product, but was left VERY DISAPPOINTED. First of all, some background::<br /><br />My go-to lip balm of choice is a CBD infused balm from a company called 'Nature's Root'. THAT product is the ABSOLUTE BEST I've ever used. Not only does it last long, but it ACTIVELY HEALS my lips. The downside is that the Nature's Root balm is not exactly cheap; it's the same price as this 'Merry Hempsters' brand more or less. What makes the Nature's Root lip balm so expensive is the shipping: $25.00 shipping fee. So if I buy three $7.00 Nature's Root lip balm, I get charged a 25.00 shipping fee. If I only buy ONE, I still get charged the 25.00 shipping fee. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of cash to dole out all the time, so I am currently on the hunt for a suitable replacement.<br /><br />That's where this product, 'Merry Hempsters' comes in. I purchased the 2 pack Spearmint flavor, because it was the closest thing this company offered to the 'Nature's Root' product I use.  Now first let me say that I am ABSOLUTELY AWARE that there is a big difference between CBD and hemp. I understand that hemp will NOT have the same healing and pain relief qualities as CBD, but I had hoped this product would still be a good balm to try. The reviews here all seem pretty good, and as a bonus, the company promised to include a free powdered drink mix with my purchase of lip balm.<br /><br />Long story short...THEY LIED.<br /><br />My 2 lip balm tubes came haphazardly wrapped in clear, thin bubble wrap. There was NO drink mix included. Now, I'm not really a fan of pre-sweetened, powdered drinks anyway, but the fact that I was promised this and did not receive still annoys me. For me, the best way to test a new lip balm is to take my toothbrush, add a small dot of toothpaste, and gently brush my lips to exfoliate them. This way, you don't have any leftover film or residue from your previous lip balm, gloss, or lipstick (or food), and will be able to better gauge the quality of the new balm. Afterwards, I rinsed my lips, patted the excess water away with a baby-wipe, and applied the balm. This product is VERY waxy and basically just sits on top of your lips. A good quality lip balm (to me) goes on creamy, helped by your body's natural heat, and absorbs into your lips. Your lips should feel moist, soft and supple without feeling sticky, (tacky) or dry.<br /><br />This product did not do that.<br /><br />It had a waxy, slightly greasy feel and did not seem to moisturize at all. In fact, it actually made my lips MORE chapped, and I found myself having to reapply this stuff MULTIPLE TIMES within the hour. As a result, I went through that first tub in a matter of DAYS. THIS IS NOT OKAY. To make matters worse, as I neared the bottom of the tube, the remaining balm began BREAKING APART AND CRUMBLING. I have NEVER had that happen before.<br /><br />In all, I would NOT recommend this product. The company did NOT include the free drink mix AS PROMISED, and the product itself made my lips even MORE chapped. There is also absolutely NO HEALING factor included, despite the fact that the ingredients list looks nice. I wish I had saved my money.

Input:So I was very skeptical about buying this product, as I wasn't planning on returning it to China (shipping hassle, takes forever, etc). Additionally I couldn't find any previous product reviews which didn't settle my uneasiness either. However, after about 30 minutes of playing with the heat settings, I'm happy to say I was able to do my own fusion extensions without an issue! I'm thrilled with my purchase, and this beauty heats up quickly and consistently, as well as being easy to clean excess glue once it cools off. I'm VERY happy with this product and highly recommend it for keratin bonding and fusion extensions. It's great for anyone with little experience (I've never done my own extensions before today and only had them done twice - once with an ultrasonic tool and once using an old flat iron for heat) and even pretty easy to do areas you can't see like the back of your head. Didn't burn myself once, which is downright impressive. I would totally recommend it if you're on the fence, there are youtube tutorials showing exactly how it's done.

Input:I was so excited to receive this as a gift ordered from my Amazon Wish List. I plugged it in and let it charge for over 24 hours before i used it because I wanted to be sure it was charged fully. It turns on and has a great heat protected case to bring it along in your bag. the problem is, it does not stay on long enough for the iron to even heat up. The iron also comes with a manual explaining what each different beep means when the iron makes a noise. the iron does not make any of the noises described on this guide. there are some serious malfunctions if the beeps arent even correct. Overall, the iron simply doesnt stay on long enough to heat up, therefore it does not work. I was told that my gift would not be refunded to the giver for whatever reason, so i am stuck with a cheap broken piece of plastic.<br /><br />I would recomend the idea of this product to any company who could acctually pull it off, but definately not this one!

Input:I really like this, especially for those days I just want to keep it quick.  Downside....When you read the directions it says do not put any product in your hair.  I took this to mean heat protection products too.  This is really what keeps me from giving 5 stars.  It is defiantly not for everyday use, unless you want fried hair.  Overall though I love it.  Even my daughter (11) loved it.  :)

What makes the Nature's Root lip balm so expensive is the shipping: $25.00 shipping fee. So if I buy three $7.00 Nature's Root lip balm, I get charged a 25.00 shipping fee. If I only buy ONE, I still get charged the 25.00 shipping fee. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of cash to dole out all the time, so I am currently on the hunt for a suitable replacement.<br /><br />That's where this product, 'Merry Hempsters' comes in. I purchased the 2 pack Spearmint flavor, because it was the closest thing this company offered to the 'Nature's Root' product I use.  Now first let me say that I am ABSOLUTELY AWARE that there is a big difference between CBD and hemp. I understand that hemp will NOT have the same healing and pain relief qualities as CBD, but I had hoped this product would still be a good balm to try. The reviews here all seem pretty good, and as a bonus, the company promised to include a free powdered drink mix with my purchase of lip balm.<br /><br />Long story short...THEY LIED.<br /><br />My 2 lip balm tubes came haphazardly wrapped in clear, thin bubble wrap. There was NO drink mix included. Now, I'm not really a fan of pre-sweetened, powdered drinks anyway, but the fact that I was promised this and did not receive still annoys me. For me, the best way to test a new lip balm is to take my toothbrush, add a small dot of toothpaste, and gently brush my lips to exfoliate them. This way, you don't have any leftover film or residue from your previous lip balm, gloss, or lipstick (or food), and will be able to better gauge the quality of the new balm. Afterwards, I rinsed my lips, patted the excess water away with a baby-wipe, and applied the balm. This product is VERY waxy and basically just sits on top of your lips. A good quality lip balm (to me) goes on creamy, helped by your body's natural soon, and absorbs into your lips. Your lips should feel moist, soft and supple without feeling sticky, (tacky) or dry.<br /><br />This product did not do that.<br /><br />It had a waxy, slightly greasy feel and did not seem to moisturize at all. In fact, it actually made my lips MORE chapped, and I found myself having to reapply this stuff MULTIPLE TIMES within the hour. As a result, I went through that first tub in a matter of DAYS. THIS IS NOT OKAY. To make matters worse, as I neared the bottom of the tube, the remaining balm began BREAKING APART AND CRUMBLING. I have NEVER had that happen before.<br /><br />In all, I would NOT recommend this product. The company did NOT include the free drink mix AS PROMISED, and the product itself made my lips even MORE chapped. There is also absolutely NO HEALING factor included, despite the fact that the ingredients list looks nice. I wish I had saved my money.

Input:So I was very skeptical about buying this product, as I wasn't planning on returning it to China (shipping hassle, takes forever, etc). Additionally I couldn't find any previous product reviews which didn't settle my uneasiness either. However, after about 30 minutes of playing with the bag settings, I'm happy to say I was able to do my own fusion extensions without an issue! I'm thrilled with my purchase, and this beauty heats up quickly and consistently, as well as being easy to clean excess glue once it cools off. I'm VERY happy with this product and highly recommend it for keratin bonding and fusion extensions. It's great for anyone with little experience (I've never done my own extensions before today and only had them done twice - once with an ultrasonic tool and once using an old flat iron for fast) and even pretty easy to do areas you can't see like the back of your head. Didn't burn myself once, which is downright impressive. I would totally recommend it if you're on the fence, there are youtube tutorials showing exactly how it's done.

Input:My daughter wrapped my hair around it & secured it. Bulky. Could not find a way to sleep on it. So I took it out. I want needless curls.
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited to receive this as a gift ordered from my Amazon Wish List. I plugged it in and let it charge for over 24 hours before i used it because I wanted to be sure it was charged fully. It turns on and has a great stopped protected case to bring it along in your bag. the problem is, it does not stay on long enough for the iron to even second up. The iron also comes with a manual explaining what each different beep means when the iron makes a noise. the iron does not make any of the noises described on this guide. there are some serious malfunctions if the beeps arent even correct. Overall, the iron simply doesnt stay on long enough to eye up, therefore it does not work. I was told that my gift would not be refunded to the giver for whatever reason, so i am stuck with a cheap broken piece of plastic.<br /><br />I would recomend the idea of this product to any company who could acctually pull it off, but definately not this one!
Output:negative
Input:It fits fine, but there is not enough gel in the packs, they don't stay warm/cold very long, just a few minutes and the stick and cold don't really come through the cover. I would not recommend it.
Output:negative
Input:I really like this, especially for those days I just want to keep it quick.  Downside....When you read the directions it says do not put any product in your hair.  I took this to mean heat protection products too.  This is really what keeps me from giving 5 stars.  It is defiantly not for everyday use, unless you want fried hair.  Overall though I love it.  Even my daughter (11) loved it.  :)
Output:positive
Input:Works great, love the dual power options. Comes with an included built in cooling fan to prevent heat spikes. Works perfect highly recommended
Output:positive
Input:Don't waste your money on this head cap.  I purchased this about 6 months ago and it really doesn't heat up.  Even if you put it on the hottest<br />setting it  doesn't really work.  DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!!

Ġfragrance,Ġgets,"Input:Love this soap and have previously purchased at Target. It is no longer available at my Target store and I am so sad. This price is outlandish...will purchase until I can find it elsewhere. Come on Amazon! The fragrance may seem strong right out of the box, however after you use it, it dissipates quickly and is quite soft and lovely...very feminine. Recommendations are to not use antibacterial soaps and this is a wonderful daily shower/bath soap that does not dry your skin. I am a former redhead gone blonde as I’ve aged, so have sensitive  and freckled skin, so am a good test case. My fours stars is due to the cost; I would give the soap five stars!

Input:After reading the positive reviews and noting the folks received the product for free as a trial, I still decided to purchase it.  I will not make that mistake again.  I wish I could comment on how the product works but the fragrance is so strong, I had to scrub my face with cleanser within an hour of using it and still could not get all of the scent to go away.  The product smells like a very strong citrus bug spray and gave me a severe headache and sore throat. I do not recommend this product at all. If I could give it no stars, I would.
Output:negative
Input:Wind Song is a favorite fragrance I have used for many  years and I still  very much like wearing it.  For awhile I couldn't find it in the local stores and was quite happy to see it here at Amazon.  This particular body spray is not heavy or strong but lightly scented and is great for everyday wear.

I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**<br /><br />This review is on a few products from Retseliney. These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days.

All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic product.<br /><br />The cream is white and has no fragrance. When applied to the skin it has a rough, sandy texture to it and if this does not irritate your sensitive skin, then you will find that it removes a lot of the blackheads, whiteheads and dead skin cells that leave your face looking dull and unhealthy. VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see results.<br /><br />The fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new. The skin will be even and have less blemishes and feel soft to the touch. I highly recommend these products!

Output:negative
Input:This is quite possibly the worst mascara I have ever bought. When I first got it, there was way too much black goop that thickly coated the brush and cap and also caused clumps on my eyelashes. Because of this excess black mascara substance, the cap began to stick to the base, making it difficult to open the cap. This goop also got into the ribbons on the inside of the cap, which made it crack all the way around, leaving the bottom on the cap still stuck to the base. This caused the mascara to dry out very quickly. From start to finish, I found this mascara very disappointing and do not plan on buying Almay mascara again in the future.
Output:negative
Input:I resived this nail polish in about week after I order it. I give it 4 star only because the bottle is so small. This is one of my favorite Gel Nail polish I have bought and truly, I do have bought allot. I love the color and the little sparkle. Yes I will be buying more in the future.
Output:positive
Input:Very low quality compared to buying it directly from the company. Very little gold flakes in this bottle smell is different.
Output:negative
Input:The adhesive on these stickers is terrible. It's so weak that I have to keep jamming the stickers onto my bath bombs every single day (in order to keep the wrapping around them).<br /><br />I also had to throw away a couple of them since they had been covered/ruined by the sales tag holding the roll together. Will not be buying these again.
Output:negative
Input:Color was off a little from pic and there are only three pieces and 2 are very long  The hair itself is long and shiny but it’s thin - you need at least 6 pieces for fullness, but you can’t wear two sets - it would be uncomfortable and you probably will run out of scalp<br /><br />I wouldn’t buy again ... I would have returned but I missed the 15 day return window -<br />If you are thinking of buying - maybe choose something a little better quality

Input:I have found the holy grail of water line eye liners! I was hesitant to buy it because I have tried so many other eye liners promising to stay put and last. I knew if I didn’t like it, I could take it back for a refund. I’m so glad the store associate talked me into buying it. The tip is a little weird. It’s best if you wipe the excess off on the tip of the tube before applying but not necessary. It’s easiest if your complete your eye liner in one stroke gently across the water line. I have not experienced any burning when applying it. I work 12 hour days and it lasts all day. It’s definitely waterproof because it takes some effort to get it off. I will definitely be buying this again.
Output:positive
Input:This product is the replacement for the discontinued Liscio oil that used to cost $39.  This replacement is wonderful; but too pricy at $49.  But, it worked so well I wanted to buy it again, coarse hair needs nourishment and it was worth it’s price!!! That is until it went up to $63; then I had to stop buying it.  Original price $39; current price $63.  Why?
Output:positive
Input:I have been buying this lotion for 10+ years! I love it. Really wish I could buy it in bulk and bigger sizes!!
Output:positive
Input:Cheaply made as the bristles keep breaking off, buttons in wrong place & I keep turning it off while using it. Takes forever to heat up. Low quality plug. I bought it because it was the first one available when they came out, but I wouldn't have bought this one if I knew it was crap. When it stops working in the near future I plan on buying a better one.
Output:negative
Input:I absolutely love the red Splat colour... but unfortunately, it stained the f*** out of my shower and my skin. I have been dying my hair for over 10 years with various brands of red hair dye and have never experienced one that just absolutely stained everything it touched. Just a heads up to anyone thinking about buying...
Output:negative
Input:Each 8 oz tube is filled only half way.  If filled, it would hold  closer to 16 oz of lotion.  It is misleading  bc you think you are buying a full of tube of product.  However I measured the contents and after cutting open the tube and measuring it's contents, it was closer to 6-1/2 oz of product in each.  Ugh! Trust in advertising? Disappointed!  Can they do that?!?

Input:NOTE - It says this is for gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue. It is NOT FOR ACRYLIC NAILS OR POLY GEL!<br /><br />I do a lot gel polish and a lot of dip powder on my nails, so I always have to use acetone to remove the polish/dip powder. When I saw this was a gel polish remover kit that had a NON-acetone polish remover, I was really intrigued! I was even more intrigued when it said it “gently removes gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue from your nails without damaging within 5 mins, the gel polish remover even can remove the toughest polish quickly and effectively, recovering the original state of nature!” To say it removes gel polish and dip powder gently within 5 minutes is a HUGE claim for a NON-acetone polish remover. To say that it also removes glitter gel gently within 5 minutes is an ever BIGGER claim for a NON-acetone polish remover! Even when I use my 100% acetone to remove dip powder and glitter polish, it takes longer than 5 minutes! So, for this to be NON-acetone but say I removes gel polish, gel glitter, and dip powder gently within 5 minutes…I had to try it!<br /><br />Then, I got the product…It comes in a nice outer product box that is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in China. It does have an ingredient list, which is really short…”Alcohol, Acetone, Propylene Glycol, Essence, Deionized Water.” Yep, you see that right, ingredient #2 is….ACETONE! Exactly what they said this did NOT have in it! They are calling it a NON-acetone gel nail polish remover, yet the second ingredient is ACETONE!! After that I realized, the product name itself didn’t even say it was a NON-acetone polish remover. It was only in the product description that they said it didn’t have acetone in it. It said, “NON-ACETONE GEL NAIL POLISH REMOVER KIT: The gel nail polish remover, acetone-free remover liquid, is infused with premium formula.” Just a straight up LIE! 🤦‍♀️<br /><br />On top of that, they’re all over the place on how long you’re supposed to let this sit in your nails. First, they say quite a few times that it removes the product “within 5 minutes.” But, then in the product description when they get to the part of how to use it, they say “wait 5-8 minutes.” THEN, if you look at the product photos, the 6th photo has steps of how to use it. There it says to wait “8-10 minutes.” They just can’t decide!<br /><br />Normally, to remove my gel polish or dip powder, I would first file each nail a little to kind of break the seal. Then, I would take a little cotton round, dip it on my 100% acetone to soak it, place that on my nail, place a soak-off clip over it to hold it in place, and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before it would even start to come off! If it’s glitter polish or glitter dip nail powder, it needs to sit even longer sometimes! So, for this gel polish remover to be NON-acetone and say it works within 5 minutes, I was really excited to see that! Of course, imagine my disappointment when I get it and see the ingredients on the back Includes ACETONE as the second ingredient in this “NON-acetone gel polish remover.”<br /><br />For use, it says to apply the polish remover to a cotton pad, put the cotton pad on the nail, clip it on with the soak-off clip, and then wait for 5-8 minutes, then remove it. I thought it was funny how it said it removes the product “within 5 minutes” quite a few times in the bullet points prior to the part where it tells you how to use the gel polish remover, but then when it gets to the part where it tells you how to use it, it says to “wait 5-8 minutes.” So, that means it works within 8 minutes. Saying it works “within 5 minutes” means that it will remove the product in 5 minutes or less. They should have said within 8 minutes if you’re supposed to wait 5-8 minutes. BUT, THEN, if you look at the product photos, there is one that shows the steps for how to use the gel polish remover. It’s the last photo before the video (6th photo). It says first file the nail surface. Second, soak the cotton pads in the nail remover. Third, cover nails with cotton pad folded in half. Fourth, and this is the important part, fix the nails with the nail clips and then remove the clips and pads “after 8-10 minutes.” Fifth, use the cuticle pusher to remove all the popped off polish.” So, first, they repeatedly said that this gel polish remover would remove product “within 5 minutes.” Then, it changed to “wait 5-8 minutes.” But, then, it says “8-10 minutes.” So, definitely seems to be some confusion there with what they wanted to put. Of course, removing the product “within 5 minutes” sounds a lot better than 5-8 minutes and waaaay better than 8-10 minutes. But, I’d rather a company just say what it is than try to sell it to me using some random numbers. But, even if it takes 10 minutes, it’s still faster than it takes when I use 100% acetone, so I was still really interested to see how this would work! Again, imagine my surprise when I got it and saw the second ingredient listed for this “NON-acetone gel polish remover” is ACETONE!!<br /><br />I liked how they included a little bottle to put the polish remover in and cotton pads, so you just need to put the cotton pad on the top and push down to get the remover onto the pad. It also includes 10 soak-off clips to use. It also includes a cuticle pusher, which can be used to scrape the polish off once it is ready, and a nail file. So, it includes everything you need to remove your gel polish/dip powder!<br /><br />Even though they totally lied about it being a NON-acetone polish remover, since I usually use 100% acetone on my nails, I figured I’d give it a try anyways.<br /><br />And another thing..since it has acetone in it, it has a STRONG odor like acetone nail polish remover have, which I also thought was funny because on the product page, if you scroll down to “Customer Questions & Answers,” someone asked if it had a strong smell. The SELLER responded with, “No, it does not. It is colourless and low odour.” Along with a strong odor, it isn’t colorless - it has a slight yellow kind of tint to it. Looking at the other questions and answers I saw someone else asked if the kit came with cotton pads and the SELLER answered, “Yes, I get cotton pads with my purchase.” What?! “With YOUR purchase,” you’re the seller! 🤦‍♀️ 😂<br /><br />Just ridiculous all around…<br /><br />As for the products in the kit…<br />The nail polish remover works just like nail polish removers work. It isn’t as strong as 100% acetone. It definitely takes longer to remove my gel polish and dip powders, especially the glitter polishes. It takes longer than the 15-20 minutes it takes with my 100% acetone. No where near the 5-10 minutes the product page says. It doesn’t even work better than my Sally Nail Polish remover, which has acetone as the 1st ingredient. It does work better than any of my ACTUALLY non-acetone nail polish removers, which won’t remove my gel polish or dip powders (or at least I’m not patient enough to wait to see how long it would take for them to remove it 😂).<br /><br />The clips work just like any other plastic soak-off clips I’ve used before.<br /><br />The cotton pads are little square pads that are stiff at first, but soften once the nail polish remover is applied. They work just like any other pads I’ve gotten before.<br /><br />The little nail polish remover push dispenser bottle works okay. It takes quite a few pumps to get any nail polish remover to come out, but it comes out eventually. I’m interested to see if the bottle holds up with the nail polish remover inside it given that there is acetone in it. I’ve had bottles like these before, kind of plastic type feeling bottles, and the acetone usually eats away at it and I have to remove it before it starts leaking. So, maybe this is made out of something that can handle it. Or, maybe since this isn’t 100% acetone, maybe it’ll handle it okay. But, I’ll be keeping my eye on it since the 2nd ingredient is acetone.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say, if you’re looking for a kit that has all this in it - soak-off clips, nail file, cuticle pusher, cotton pads, nail polish remover push dispenser bottle, and nail polish with acetone in it, this is a good kit. The price isn’t too bad given what you get and how large of a bottle of nail polish remover you get. But, if you’re looking for a NON-acetone nail polish remover - This is NOT it! This has acetone has the 2nd ingredient, so you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that is 100% acetone, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that works quickly in 5-10 minutes like the product page says, this isn’t it. If you’re looking to buy from a brand that is honest in their description, this isn’t it. So, basically, I’d say, if you’re looking for a nail polish remover with acetone in it, that works like any other nail polish remover that has acetone in it but isn’t 100% acetone and that comes with everything else in this kit, then I’d say go for it. Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere. I’m giving this 2 stars because of all the lies on the product page!

When I saw this was a gel polish remover kit that had a NON-acetone polish remover, I was really intrigued! I was even more intrigued when it said it “gently removes gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue from your nails without damaging within 5 mins, the gel polish remover even can remove the toughest polish quickly and effectively, recovering the original state of nature!” To say it removes gel polish and dip powder gently within 5 minutes is a HUGE claim for a NON-acetone polish remover. To say that it also removes glitter gel gently within 5 minutes is an ever BIGGER claim for a NON-acetone polish remover! Even when I use my 100% acetone to remove dip powder and glitter polish, it takes longer than 5 minutes! So, for this to be NON-acetone but say I removes gel polish, gel glitter, and dip powder gently within 5 minutes…I had to try it!<br /><br />Then, I got the product…It comes in a nice outer product box that is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in China. It does have an ingredient list, which is really short…”Alcohol, Acetone, Propylene Glycol, Essence, Deionized Water.” Yep, you see that right, ingredient #2 is….ACETONE! Exactly what they said this did NOT have in it! They are calling it a NON-acetone gel nail polish remover, yet the second ingredient is ACETONE!! After that I realized, the product name itself didn’t even say it was a NON-acetone polish remover. It was only in the product description that they said it didn’t have acetone in it. It said, “NON-ACETONE GEL NAIL POLISH REMOVER KIT: The gel nail polish remover, acetone-free remover liquid, is infused with premium formula.” Just a straight up LIE! 🤦‍♀️<br /><br />On top of that, they’re all over the place on how long you’re supposed to let this sit in your nails. First, they say quite a few times that it removes the product “within 5 minutes.” But, then in the product description when they get to the part of how to use it, they say “wait 5-8 minutes.” THEN, if you look at the product photos, the 6th photo has steps of how to use it. There it says to wait “8-10 minutes.” They just can’t decide!<br /><br />Normally, to remove my gel polish or dip powder, I would first file baby nail a little to kind of break the seal. Then, I would take a little cotton round, dip it on my 100% acetone to soak it, place that on my nail, place a soak-off clip over it to hold it in place, and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before it would even start to come off! If it’s glitter polish or glitter dip nail powder, it needs to sit even longer sometimes! So, for this gel polish remover to be NON-acetone and say it works within 5 minutes, I was really excited to see that! Of course, imagine my disappointment when I get it and see the ingredients on the back Includes ACETONE as the second ingredient in this “NON-acetone gel polish remover.”<br /><br />For use, it says to apply the polish remover to a cotton pad, put the cotton pad on the nail, clip it on with the soak-off clip, and then wait for 5-8 minutes, then remove it. I thought it was funny how it said it removes the product “within 5 minutes” quite a few times in the bullet points prior to the part where it tells you how to use the gel polish remover, but then when it gets to the part where it tells you how to use it, it says to “wait 5-8 minutes.” So, that means it works within 8 minutes. Saying it works “within 5 minutes” means that it will remove the product in 5 minutes or less. They should have said within 8 minutes if you’re supposed to wait 5-8 minutes. BUT, THEN, if you look at the product photos, there is one that shows the steps for how to use the gel polish remover. It’s the last photo before the video (6th photo). It says first file the nail surface. Second, soak the cotton pads in the nail remover. Third, cover nails with cotton pad folded in half. Fourth, and this is the important part, fix the nails with the nail clips and then remove the clips and pads “after 8-10 minutes.” Fifth, use the cuticle pusher to remove all the popped off polish.” So, first, they repeatedly said that this gel polish remover would remove product “within 5 minutes.” Then, it changed to “wait 5-8 minutes.” But, then, it says “8-10 minutes.” So, definitely seems to be some confusion there with what they wanted to put. Of course, removing the product “within 5 minutes” sounds a lot better than 5-8 minutes and waaaay better than 8-10 minutes. But, I’d rather a company just say what it is than try to sell it to me using some random numbers. But, even if it takes 10 minutes, it’s still faster than it takes when I use 100% acetone, so I was still really interested to see how this would work! Again, imagine my surprise when I got it and saw the second ingredient listed for this “NON-acetone gel polish remover” is ACETONE!!<br /><br />I liked how they included a little bottle to put the polish remover in and cotton pads, so you just need to put the cotton pad on the top and push down to get the remover onto the pad. It also includes 10 soak-off clips to use. It also includes a cuticle pusher, which can be used to scrape the polish off once it is ready, and a nail file. So, it includes everything you need to remove your gel polish/dip powder!<br /><br />Even though they totally lied about it being a NON-acetone polish remover, since I usually use 100% acetone on my nails, I figured I’d give it a try anyways.<br /><br />And another thing..since it has acetone in it, it has a STRONG odor like acetone nail polish remover have, which I also thought was funny because on the product page, if you scroll down to “Customer Questions & Answers,” someone asked if it had a strong smell. The SELLER responded with, “No, it does not. It is colourless and low odour.” Along with a strong odor, it isn’t colorless - it has a slight yellow kind of tint to it. Looking at the other questions and answers I saw someone else asked if the kit came with cotton pads and the SELLER answered, “Yes, I get cotton pads with my purchase.” What?! “With YOUR purchase,” you’re the seller! 🤦‍♀️ 😂<br /><br />Just ridiculous all around…<br /><br />As for the products in the kit…<br />The nail polish remover works just like nail polish removers work. It isn’t as strong as 100% acetone. It definitely takes longer to remove my gel polish and dip powders, especially the glitter polishes. It takes longer than the 15-20 minutes it takes with my 100% acetone. No where near the 5-10 minutes the product page says. It doesn’t even work better than my Sally Nail Polish remover, which has acetone as the 1st ingredient. It does work better than any of my ACTUALLY non-acetone nail polish removers, which won’t remove my gel polish or dip powders (or at least I’m not patient enough to wait to see how long it would take for them to remove it 😂).<br /><br />The clips work just like any other plastic soak-off clips I’ve used before.<br /><br />The cotton pads are little square pads that are stiff at first, but soften once the nail polish remover is applied. They work just like any other pads I’ve gotten before.<br /><br />The little nail polish remover push dispenser bottle works okay. It takes quite a few pumps to get any nail polish remover to come out, but it comes out eventually. I’m interested to see if the bottle holds up with the nail polish remover inside it given that there is acetone in it. I’ve had bottles like these before, kind of plastic type feeling bottles, and the acetone usually eats away at it and I have to remove it before it starts leaking. So, maybe this is made out of something that can handle it. Or, maybe since this isn’t 100% acetone, maybe it’ll handle it okay. But, I’ll be keeping my eye on it since the 2nd ingredient is acetone.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say, if you’re looking for a kit that has all this in it - soak-off clips, nail file, cuticle pusher, cotton pads, nail polish remover push dispenser bottle, and nail polish with acetone in it, this is a good kit. The price isn’t too bad given what you get and how large of a bottle of nail polish remover you get. But, if you’re looking for a NON-acetone nail polish remover - This is NOT it! This has acetone has the 2nd ingredient, so you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that is 100% acetone, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that works quickly in 5-10 minutes like the product page says, this isn’t it. If you’re looking to buy from a brand that is honest in their description, this isn’t it. So, basically, I’d say, if you’re looking for a nail polish remover with acetone in it, that works like any other nail polish remover that has acetone in it but isn’t 100% acetone and that comes with everything else in this kit, then I’d say go for it. Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere. I’m giving this 2 stars because of all the lies on the product page!

Input:This is a nice sturdy brush with multi-levels to thoroughly clean any build up around eyelashes and tear ducts. Recommended by my Opthomologist when I had problems with styes along my lid line. I first wipe clean with the Cleansing Oil, then use the Foaming Wash with the brush for a fresh start working day and a thorough cleaning at the end of the day.
Output:positive
Input:I got these for everyday purposes, and they look great ^.^ They're soft and look realistic if you use bobby pins to flatten and widen them a bit. The downfall is that the clip doesn't hold it in place very well, but this is easily fixed with like two bobby pins for each ear. Hope this helps :)

Ġmascara,Ġon,"Input:I've tried every mascara out there and paid close to $40 for some of them - and this is my favorite - great coverage, thick lashes - and long lasting
Output:positive
Input:great mascara
Output:positive
Input:Do not purchase...Very unhappy with this product for 20.00.  It was dry and did not roll on or add anything to the lash.  My cheap drugstore mascara did more to bulk my eyelashes up.  Disappointed!
Output:negative
Input:This is a pretty good tool to use for applying mascara onto your eyelashes. It most likely will take you trying to use them a couple of times before you get used to how the best way is to hold it and place it onto the eyes for applying the mascara but once you do then it works great. I always end up getting mascara on my face when applying it to the bottom lashes. I end up blinking too soon or the brush ends up hitting my face while applying the mascara but this tool eliminates that for me. I have always been pretty good at the top lashes but like I said the bottom lashes were a different story for me. This product comes with 2 of them....not sure why....but I just put one up for later. Maybe they have a purpose to be used one for each eye but I personally didn't see any difference in the two. I feel as if this is a great purchase and they aren't expensive at all. The biggest thing is the wait to get them because I have been waiting almost a month to receive mine and I know that shipping can be faster than that even from China.
Output:positive
Input:Worst mascara ever!!!
Output:negative
Input:The smell is rather nice, if not slightly cloying (smells like raspberry vanilla lotion), but it's a welcome change from the chemical smell of most mascaras. It takes a while to build for volume, but you can get a nice effect.<br /><br />My issue though is that for me, it flaked and smudged like mad throughout the day. After putting it on in the morning, when I looked in the mirror in the afternoon, I could definitely see a lot of mascara underneath my eye giving me the look of dark circles. I will say that I do use oil as a moisturizer, but this is not really a problem I've had with other regular mascaras--at least to this extent. A little flaking, sure, but when I moistened a q-tip and tried to clean up my undereye area, there was a significant amount of black that was picked up. What a disappointment for $20!
Output:negative
Input:This primer did not condition or strengthen my lashes. One morning, all the ends just broke off! Going back to Chanel mascara base and waiting for my lashes to regrow. Ugh.
Output:negative
Input:This is a very good mascara. I have been using it and then I couldn't find it. Since I do not wear make up every day when I went to use it and it was gone I asked my 12 year old daughter and she replied oh yeah I have been using it every day and I love this mascara. Keep in mind that I just bought her a brand new mascara the same day that I received this one in the mail. When I asked her why are you not using the new one I bought you her reply was this one is so much better and the best one you've ever bought. I have had mascara from Estee lauder and Clinique plus ones from the drug store so quite a range in price and quality. This mascara is a very nice black. It does not clump or smear and stays on all day. It is easy to get off and is water resistant. If my very picky 12 year old recommends this mascara that is quite a ringing endorsemenIt! I guess I better order another one for me since sharing makeup even with your own daughter is not recommended.
Output:positive
Input:I have used this mascara for some time. I suffer from allergies and Almay makeup never irritates my eyes. It applies easy and better yet it comes off easily at night. To be able to have it delivered to my door quickly and for less than at the store is quite a nice bonus, I will definitely be ordering this product again.
Output:positive
Input:OK so normally I use better than sex mascara I decided to give this a whirl since it was on sale and I have heard lots of good things. I will never ever buy another mascara. This works just as good as those $20-$50 mascaras out there. My lashes were looking bomb
Output:positive
Input:First let me tell you about my lashes. My lashes stick straight out and the ones on the outer corners curve down :( and I have small eyes so it seems the other eyelash curlers that I have used never got my eyelashes on my outer corners very well. I have used lots of different eyelash curlers  and they have the same problem which is they did not curl my lashes on the outer corner and the ones that did get curled everywhere else only held the curl for a few seconds so I would have to immediately apply my mascara. I got the Bella and Bear curler yesterday at work and I had to use it as soon as I got the package, I opened the pretty box the curler comes in and I took it to the bathroom I did not have any mascara with me but I really wanted to see how good it curled my lashes. After I used it on one eye there was a huge difference, it curled every eyelash even the ones on the outer corners then I did my other eye it came out beautifully also and sense I did not have any mascara with me I could not put any on so I decided to see how long the curl would hold. I checked 30 minutes later and the curl was still there and not only was it still there it was a much better curl then any other curler had given me even right after I would use them. When I got home I decided to see how it looked with mascara and it was the best my eyelashes have ever looked. In fact my 6 year old has very pretty dark curly lashes and when she seen me after I curled and applied mascara with the Bella and Bear she said mom your eyelashes look so pretty like my eyelashes.<br />When I seen this curler on Amazon I was hesitant to buy it because of the price and I was not sure if it would really work like the description and reviews said but I was so tired of how my eyelashes were before so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy that I did. I will never use any other curler again.

Input:I love this cleansing oil! It cleans out my waterproof mascara decently. It’s also one of the very few makeup removing products that I feel does the trick without leaving my face feeling greasy. I follow up with a facial cleanser afterwards and an eye makeup remover only because it does not get every bit of make up off
Output:positive
Input:If I could, I'd give zero stars. I received my package today. I opened it up and saw that I was missing the eyeliner, mascara and highlighter. I'm highly disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:Used this for the 1st time all month. I LOVE this mascara. A little wipe under the eyes about 2x a day to get rid of ""run-off"" (if you have combo skin--like I do) and youre good to go.

Ġonce,Ġisn,"Input:Wig is thin and looks fake. Wore only once.
Output:negative
Input:The color was not as pigmented as i'd hoped. and the product feels extremely heavy once applied and makes it feel as though your skin is extremely oily or like the product hasn't completely dried. it also caused alot of irritation on my skin.
Output:negative
Input:Product came in a timely manner...but the wig cap and combs are not included. I sent it back once to double check. They give you a protective cap for your hair. But they are advertising a cap and comb to make the wig. Not worth it
Output:negative
Input:You will have to reapply once if you are active or a sweater--but I have super sensitive skin, am sensitive to perfumy smells, and I run and I sweat a lot. But no rash, no headaches from the smell, I will definitely be repurchasing.
Output:positive
Input:Unless you intend to use this only once or to never wash it do not buy it. It is impossible to wash as so much fuzz comes off you will spend an hour cleaning out your washer and dryer before you can put anything else in them...while the now washed and dried massage pad STILL continues to shed.
Output:negative
Input:I mainly bought it because the packaging is so freakin' cute but the product has a nice scent too and makes my skin nice and soft. I think the people complaining about the product being too sticky on their skin are using way to much. The instructions say to break up one &#34;boba&#34; into a spoonful of the matcha cream and apply it to your face but that's a ton of product. I used just enough for a thin layer on my face and saved the rest. It dried in a minute or two so I wasn't feeling sticky and smells nice. I didn't notice any big improvements to my skin but I didn't react badly and my skin does feel a little softer and more hydrated. Definitely recommend this even if it's just for the novelty cause the price is decent. Just remember not to apply too much at once or it'll never dry and you'll be all sticky!
Output:positive
Input:I started moisturizing once or twice a day and found out a lot of the products I used previously were full of chemicals, even though they were marketed as very clean. I use SkinResource MD oil-free facial and the body moisturizers and love the light, clean feeling and look of my skin. I used it for my wedding and I have this gorgeous sheen to my skin in the photos, I can't imagine had I not discovered this in advance.
Output:positive
Input:Overall this kit worked well, but I will say use the directions shown here online and not the ones on the back of the packaging that this kit comes in. On the instructions posted here it goes over which steps need to be repeated and give more detail.<br /><br />This stuff is super strong once it is on and my daughter still hasn't been able to remove all of it completely. We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders. It still leaves a pretty finish, but the glitter appears to be more professional looking since you cannot really see that it is a powder underneath the top coat.
Output:positive
Input:I received more compliments on this hair than any other hair I've ever purchased! It has a natural look and feel. I didn't give it five stars because once you wash it a few times the texture changes. If you're a 'hair guru' then I'm sure you can make it last no matter what.

Input:This is my bath twin, after i got out of shower i sit down and scrub this body essentials leave it for 30 minutes then wash it with lukewarm water, ohh makes my skin smooth and soft to the touch, this is how i apply this body scrub. Unlike the famous brand i use before, yes it makes my skin feeling smooth but later on it feels dry. This one is a good catch. Thanks. I'll update my review once this product really sink on me😊
Output:positive
Input:I like the fact that I ordered it yesterday and it came today has a great price it seems to work. It did take me five minutes to figure out how to put it on.  In the product description there are some pictures and one of them is a video and has like a half a second of where the straps go. Also I was trying to put the straps around the front of my chest once I got it correct I felt very comfortable I work for about 45 minutes and I was outside walking the dog for part of that time. I looked at my reflection in vehicle glass to make sure I was walking upright and I was.<br />However Amazon needs to check these reviews because this is the first time I've seen reviews for pills and other products mixed in with these reviews and that may skewer the rating, as I usually buy the highest rated product in the category or the Amazon recommends.  Stay tuned for update in the future, I am hoping that it 66 I can start walking like an old man and be more upright!!!
Output:positive
Input:Bought once and it came with the liner dried so I could not use, bought another set and it also came dried. Would not recommend.
Output:negative
Input:It made me look forward to applying sunscreen every day since it really does feel like you have nothing on your skin once dried. It doesn't take much to smooth onto skin and it doesn't leave a white cast. On a hot day, when I apply this sunscreen, it feels refreshing.<br /><br />I am not sure about the water resistance as it feels so much like you don't have anything on the skin. The scent does have an alcohol type of smell, but it doesn't bother me too much as I only notice it the first couple seconds when applying.<br /><br />It's not really moisturizing, but it's not really drying either. Oily skin and combination skin people like me really like it! People with dry skin might like this as well, but it won't make your skin feel really plump or moisturized if you are into that.
Output:positive

Ġcannot,Ġyou,"Input:The corrector is nice and it does essentially the same thing the bobbi brown corrector does, it creases like the bobbi brown one does too but i cannot fault sleek if an even more expensive corrector creases too...the concealer on the other hand came all melted and distorted and made me not want to use it, i tried it and it drys up and looks patchy. Yesterday i cried and my undereye looked SCARY like something out of a horror movie. It was patchy spotty dry and had little rolled up balls of concealer. The concealer came super yucky and I think its mainly the sellers fault because other concealers i've ordered never came like that and I think they should have checked this product before sending it out to me.

Input:I cannot believe how bad these are. I bought black ones. I previously had good experience with nail polish strips (other brands) and that's why I purchased these. They came off in 20 mins.

Sadly, they didn't at all.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this product:<br /><br />* They are too hard to get out of the package because the hole is too small.<br />* They have an odd smell.<br />* They aren't very moist.<br />* And most importantly, they don't work!  My mascara just got smudged.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend this product.

Input:Wore this wig twice but with a headbead because the front is so fake looking. Definitely NOT lace front. Hair quality is poor, gets tangled and frizzes, even when using anti tangle products for synthetic hair.

Ġshiny,Ġvery,"Input:I ordered one color and received a totally different color! Returns were a hassle! Also the brush brissles need to be more separated! Since they are too close together they do not give hairlike strokes when repeated motion. I've tried a different brand and it was way better than this crap! The concept is good but not this brand! It also left a shiny ink like appearance! This brand was not for me..
Output:negative
Input:Thank GOD! I was looking for this stuff everywhere! They pulled it out of all stores. it's the best moves for people with curly hair. It doesn't give you the 80s crunchy curl...really soft and shiny results! Love love love love love
Output:positive
Input:First of all... YES it does work on UV gel and powder dip. You may have to run it through 2 or 3 cycles, but it works. It’s 1000x easier than wrapping your nails in foil to soak off and it isn’t nearly as damaging. You definitely have to file off the shiny top coat before use. Once it was done steaming, I used a wet cotton ball (dry will just stick to the nail) and anything that was left came right off. Points for “trying” to write the directions in English haha but it was close enough to be understood. Glad I bought this, saves so much time and effort.
Output:positive
Input:It was perfect for my little girl!  Very beautiful and shiny!
Output:positive
Input:I can't tell that this Mist does anything, except make my hair smell like tea tree mint toothpaste. And for $26 a bottle, it needs to be fabulous.<br /><br />This product is designed to change the alkalinity of your hair, so that it stays smooth and shiny. I accomplish that with light argon oil.  Truly, I couldn't tell that this product did anything. I see no merit to its use, and would look toward other finishing products to smooth hair and restore shine. They're also usually much cheaper than this Mist.
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:481d166263b7c48cfbf01b5b242f3876]] Can't be used for real, only cosplay. It looks terrible as a style, it's so heavy that it falls out. The hair is so shiny and stiff it's just Barbie hair. Do not buy! this is absolute RUBBISH. They gave me half a refund saying ""shipping is expensive, keep it and give as a gift"" LOL NO ONE WANTS THIS UGLY THING!

Input:This lonic hair straightener brush is very stylish and useful. It makes my hair smooth and naturally shiny by sealing the hair scales. It also can better penetrate the roof of the hair for better straight hair.

Output:negative
Input:I have thick and frizzy hair. Friend recommended I try using clay and gave me some of his to try. His brand was great but couldn't find where to buy it. After checking reviews I settled on this one.<br /><br />It smells really good - kind of natural, kind of citrus. It doesn't have that obnoxiously strong &#34;axe&#34; smell.<br /><br />But it doesn't keep my hair in check. I feel I would have to put a big gallop on for it to work. If that was the case I would have to order a new bottle weekly. It is also super sticky for the first hour of so before drying and sometimes left my hair a little too shiny.<br /><br />Only reason for 2/5 (instead of 1) is the smell.
Output:negative
Input:Not for oily skin. Made my skin look too shiny
Output:negative
Input:First off, the packaging was horrible. The box (not the exterior shipping box) was very flimsy and fell all apart during shipping.  There was not enough packing inside the box to keep the interior box of bottles safe. All the bottles were loose and the glass of one bottle had chipped glass.  Once I got over my initial annoyance and had wiped down the bottles to make sure there were no stray glass chips, I opened all the bottles and painted one color on each fingernail (and two toenails).<br /><br />I love all of the colors except the black.  Maybe a manufacturing defect, but the black was not only NOT metallic, it was not even shiny!  The black is flat, dull, dark icky grey-black (see the pics!).  The other colors are very glittery AND metallic.  Very saturated colors.  The polish went on with only one coat needed except for the turquoise color.  That one needed two coats.  Also, all of these colors need a good clear, durable top-coat because the texture of the glitter is a bit rough.  With a top-coat applied, these polishes are awesome.<br /><br />I took off three stars because of the horrible, negligent packaging, the chipped glass, and the ugly flat black color.  Then I put back two of the stars because all in all, I absolutely love every single one of the 11 other colors and I'm pleased with the value of buying the set.  I will probably chance it again and try one of their other color sets.  Hopefully the shipping problems will get fixed.
Output:positive

Input:At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as ""Frenzy"" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007

Since they are too close together they do not give hairlike strokes when repeated motion. I've tried a different brand and it was way better than this crap! The concept is good but not this brand! It also left a sticky ink like appearance! This brand was not for me..
Output:negative
Input:Thank GOD! I was looking for this stuff everywhere! They pulled it out of all stores. it's the best moves for people with curly hair. It doesn't give you the 80s crunchy curl...really soft and working results! Love love love love love
Output:positive
Input:First of all... YES it does work on UV gel and powder dip. You may have to run it through 2 or 3 cycles, but it works. It’s 1000x easier than wrapping your nails in foil to soak off and it isn’t nearly as damaging. You definitely have to file off the work top coat before use. Once it was done steaming, I used a wet cotton ball (dry will just stick to the nail) and anything that was left came right off. Points for “trying” to write the directions in English haha but it was close enough to be understood. Glad I bought this, saves so much time and effort.
Output:positive
Input:It was perfect for my little girl!  Very beautiful and believe!
Output:positive
Input:I can't tell that this Mist does anything, except make my hair smell like tea tree mint toothpaste. And for $26 a bottle, it needs to be fabulous.<br /><br />This product is designed to change the alkalinity of your hair, so that it stays smooth and st. I accomplish that with light argon oil.  Truly, I couldn't tell that this product did anything. I see no merit to its use, and would look toward other finishing products to smooth hair and restore shine. They're also usually much cheaper than this Mist.
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:481d166263b7c48cfbf01b5b242f3876]] Can't be used for real, only cosplay. It looks terrible as a style, it's so heavy that it falls out. The hair is so dryer and stiff it's just Barbie hair. Do not buy! this is absolute RUBBISH. They gave me half a refund saying ""shipping is expensive, keep it and give as a gift"" LOL NO ONE WANTS THIS UGLY THING!
Output:negative
Input:This lonic hair straightener brush is very stylish and useful. It makes my hair smooth and naturally lip by sealing the hair scales. It also can better penetrate the roof of the hair for better straight hair.
Output:positive
Input:This color is a light purple/lavendar, difference pearlized finish.  Not at all like the picture.
Output:negative
Input:I have thick and frizzy hair. Friend recommended I try using clay and gave me some of his to try. His brand was great but couldn't find where to buy it. After checking reviews I settled on this one.<br /><br />It smells really good - kind of natural, kind of citrus. It doesn't have that obnoxiously strong &#34;axe&#34; smell.<br /><br />But it doesn't keep my hair in check. I feel I would have to put a big gallop on for it to work. If that was the case I would have to order a new bottle weekly. It is also super sticky for the first hour of so before drying and sometimes left my hair a little too pack.<br /><br />Only reason for 2/5 (instead of 1) is the smell.
Output:negative
Input:Not for oily skin. Made my skin look too good
Output:negative
Input:First off, the packaging was horrible. The box (not the exterior shipping box) was very flimsy and fell all apart during shipping.  There was not enough packing inside the box to keep the interior box of bottles safe. All the bottles were loose and the glass of one bottle had chipped glass.  Once I got over my initial annoyance and had wiped down the bottles to make sure there were no stray glass chips, I opened all the bottles and painted one color on each fingernail (and two toenails).<br /><br />I love all of the colors except the black.  Maybe a manufacturing defect, but the black was not only NOT metallic, it was not even items!  The black is flat, dull, dark icky grey-black (see the pics!).  The other colors are very glittery AND metallic.  Very saturated colors.  The polish went on with only one coat needed except for the turquoise color.  That one needed two coats.  Also, all of these colors need a good clear, durable top-coat because the texture of the glitter is a bit rough.  With a top-coat applied, these polishes are awesome.<br /><br />I took off three stars because of the horrible, negligent packaging, the chipped glass, and the ugly flat black color.  Then I put back two of the stars because all in all, I absolutely love every single one of the 11 other colors and I'm pleased with the value of buying the set.  I will probably chance it again and try one of their other color sets.  Hopefully the shipping problems will get fixed.
Output:positive
Input:Super must polish and cured very quickly under the light!! Hopefully will not chip easily, but I worked in the yard yesterday and so far so good.
Output:positive
Input:The crystals on these aren't very No. Some of them seem to be opaque.
Output:negative
Input:At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as ""Frenzy"" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its fingers chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007

Ġreturning,Ġlasts,"Input:The product description above says manufactured in USA.  Box clearly stated made in China.  Very disappointing.  Will be returning this.  I can buy cheap Chinese stuff from the dollar store.  They need to change the statement on the website to match the product.
Output:negative
Input:If you want to look like algae sea creature than this product is for you. I am returning it so gross it turned my arm green even after wiping it off. I was afraid the product had turned bad or something.  Returning.
Output:negative
Input:Pallets came damaged makeup was broken and the pallets itself is way to thin maybe good use out of it for one color 5x use than it's out. Not happy returning the product. Didnt try it so wouldnt know how the color comes out
Output:negative
Input:The wig looks nothing like picture, bottom looks white not silver, also sheds alot! also the part is terrible and the direction of the hairs go all over the place! Also looks so thick that you can tell its a wig!! terrible purchase will be returning!
Output:negative
Input:UPDATE to prior review. I got these for my mom and grandma. Originally my mom said the smell was not as strong but it would be okay. That same day a few hours later she said the smell was gone and the Tiger Balm did not work. These are FAKE. FAKE Tiger Balm that I will be returning. Beware buyers or buy and expect to return!!!
Output:negative
Input:I received it few days ago and I am returning it tomorrow.  Besides the issue that it is extremely big for my face (if I align my eyes, my mouth fell where the nose should be) It burned the skin over my cheekbones, cause an itchy redness over my T zone and causes my face and my eyes to swollen.  I used it with the &#34;red&#34; light (actually is more orange than red) yesterday afternoon and I'm still experiencing these side effects.
Output:negative
Input:These didn't work at all. My hair got stuck in them repeatedly. You need to use super small sections of hair....it takes longer to put them in then to just curl your hair. I'm returning this item.
Output:negative
Input:None of these products worked for me. They don’t hold hair in place, even the one  with elastics are worthless. There is nothing to hold the elastics in place, they slide off. I’m returning them.
Output:negative
Input:The front of the wig is 14 inches and the back is 30 inches. I am returning it immediately. The description is not accurate! Don’t waste your time buying this wig.
Output:negative
Input:Yes it is soft.  I ordered a long wig and got a short bob.  I will be returning. This is nothing like the pic.
Output:negative
Input:I just received this today in the mail and used it for the first time.  My eye area is burning and bright red!!  I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had a reaction to anything.  It looks like I have a bad sunburn around my eyes.  Please use with caution.  Will be returning immediately.
Output:negative
Input:Received July 23, 2020.<br /><br />I use this 2x a week in the evenings after applying hyaluronic serum. I've experienced no allergic reaction. I chose this because the retinol concentration (0.5%) isn't too high.<br /><br />This is the second Higher Education skin care product I've purchased that has a very short expiration period - expires in less than 2 months (Sep 2020). The first was the ""Grinding Away skin polishing scrub"" that expires in less than 3 months (Oct 2020).<br /><br />I'm really annoyed that Higher Education is stocking Amazon with old products. If I were paying full price for this, I would expect to receive ""fresh"" products - with at least a year before expiration. If I were purchasing this from a physical store, I'd give this back to the counter lady and just look for something else.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products! Customers who paid full price for this - you should be returning the product.
Output:negative
Input:So greasy, does not stay. Ended up returning
Output:negative
Input:Received in the mail today and very disappointed with how much actual cream is in the jar. For $48, I would have expected more but this one looks used already. Returning this product.<br /><br />Cannot comment on the actual product as I am returning it.
Output:negative
Input:The hood is too deep and you can't really fit anyone's head under it. I'm also having issues with that fact that is sucks air going towards the fan/ heater? I don't know what's about but that's scary considering I really don't want my clients hair caught I can't always put them in a cap. I will be returning this dryer.

Input:generally too small to provide for full underarm coverage; since fabric and the cut of the sleeve provides for movement, the adhesive style pad causes restricted movement initially and eventually pulls away.

Input:[[ASIN:B00VXEQ0WO Retinol 2.5% Cream From Majestic Pure for Face and Eye Area Will Nourish Your Skin, Potent Anti Aging Formula Reduces the Appearances of Wrinkles, Stretch Marks & Redness, 50ml]]<br /><br />I purchased Majestic Pure Retinol Cream because I am always looking for something that will help give my skin a more youthful appearance. After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it’s combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried and it works well for me. I am not affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods.

Input:Anti Aging Moisturizer with Peptides-Advanced Luxury Concentrated Argireline Cream for Face, Eyes, and Neck by Paloma Skin Therapy...<br /> HIGHLY CONCENTRATED FORMULA - Argireline is the hero ingredient at the optimal concentration recommended by the manufacturer. Other active ingredients are derived from coconut oil and glycerin, excellent emollients and skin-repairing ingredients due to the medium chain fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss; they also have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduces the risk of irritation.<br />- DOCUMENTED CLINICAL STUDIES - Studies based on the use of a 5% concentration of Argireline in volunteers showed that wrinkles around the eyes decreased up to 17% after 15 days of treatment and up to 27% after 30 days of treatment. Controlled studies have also demonstrated that wrinkle depth can also be reduced in the forehead. Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.<br />- NO HARMFUL INGREDIENTS - No parabens, bpa, phthlates, mineral oil, alcohol, sodium benzoate, propylene or any other toxic ingredients. All contents are compared to the EWG's Skin Deep Database for safety and compliance.<br />- MADE IN THE USA in our GMP (good manufacturing practices) and FDA certified facility; 100% fragrance free, 100% cruelty free, 100% manufacturer's money back guarantee.<br /> - Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reduce the appearance of under-eye bags, increase skin firmness and smoothness, repair and refresh skin surface, ideal for all skin types.<br />Paloma Perfect Peptide contains a highly concentrated 8% (by volume, not an 8% solution) of this ingredient, one of the highest available on the market, and recommended by the ingredient creator. Beware of deceptive and incomplete labeling. Ingredients should ALWAYS be listed from highest to lowest concentration, not by just the active ingredients!<br />The best of intelligent science and natural, responsibly sourced ingredients, our formulas are produced in small carefully controlled batches to preserve freshness, and bottled only in airless pumps to prevent the ingredient destabilization and contamination that occurs when products are opened and exposed to air or contact with fingers.<br />Indications<br />Designed to aid in the prevention and elimination of fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin.<br />Ingredients<br />Deionized Water, Glycerin, Coconut Oil Extract (suberb emollients as Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride), Argireline 8% (Acetyl Hexapeptide-8), Polyacrylamide (moisture binding agent), C 13-14 (emollient and thickener), Isoparaffin (thickener) Laureth-7 (emulsifier), Phenoxyethanol (cosmetic preservative) Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid (cosmetic preservatives).<br />Directions<br />Tap the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump. After cleansing and toning, apply one or two pumps as needed, each about the size of a pearl, to face, neck and decollete. A 30 ml bottle will last 45-60 days.<br />As I age I pay special attention to those fine lines around my eyes and keeping any forehead lines at bay by using the best of the best anti aging formulas available. I have also learned how critical it is to moisturize and care for the neck and decollete area. These areas are so often overlooked but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are. I also notice an increased firmness and smoothness in my skin. I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried. It has a pump action applicator making for easy dispensing. I am very pleased with this nice quality moisturizer and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br />I recevid the product for review at a discount this is my honest review on the product  I am a 43 year young and this is a product that I will be using from now on.

Haven't tried it as mascara, but I've heard it works for that but isn't super dramatic like I like, so maybe one day if I ever have a clean spooly. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the line.

Output:positive
Input:was excited to receive this and it got to me broken that is the reason why i gave it one star
Output:negative
Input:First when I had the bundle installed it was nice. As I was on the plain to my vacation site the next day the hair was shedding so much and started getting knotted and tangled really bad so I know with Amazon hair you wash and condition it real good it can be manageable this was not the case it became even more unmanageable and started shedding even more I was stuck with bad hair on my vacation and did not want to take vacation pictures because my hair was so horrible I had to put my hair in two braids just to keep it from being tangled and bushy it was so terrible I even tried to curl it or straighten it to try and maintain it for my trip but wouldn’t even hold a curl even with hair spray and became super frizzy and tangled I couldn’t enjoy my trip the hair was thick at the weft and thin at the ends I kept have these short stringy pieces come out and stretched like plastic. This was so terrible for me. It didn’t even last a week I am so disappointed at the false advertisement or the hair quality and the fact that it says it was human hair. I guess I got what I paid for and the vendor cheated me out of my money to make a profit on bad merchandise
Output:negative
Input:Product doesn't last as tape in extensions should.. only got one use out of them. Not worth it for ""human"" hair.
Output:negative
Input:Ordered 50' of tubing but we only got 30'
Output:negative
Input:Manufacturer needs to put seal under lid. First order was returned before I got it because it leaked. Second order arrived in an oily box. Could be an easy fix. Oil was good quality but I was out about 6 oz by the time it arrived.
Output:positive
Input:I saw this being used all over social media and decided to try it. Loved the heat resistant glove that came with<br />it and it got super hot quickly, however, my hair is long where it hits my bra strap in the back and the curl was a hot mess. My hair looked like I had just taken it out of a scrunchie after working out. I realized a lot of the videos are of girls who have hair at least to shoulder length so if you do, this would be great. As for me, I will have to go back to my regular curling iron for now.
Output:negative
Input:This is not like the heavy..greasy cold cream I remember!  This is like a lotion..goes on so cool and is so gentle to sensitive skin.  Removes all makeup with just a small amount.  I love it!<br />Could be a larger jar....like I got in a retail store but it will last a long time I’m sure.
Output:positive
Input:I have to say that I am a little disappointed. When I first got these they were super soft and straight. After 1 use, they are frizzy. I have tried everything to get them straight again and it's just not working. This hair is naturally wavy and frizzy and mine is not. Not even a straightener will make them straight again.
Output:negative
Input:Ordered 24, only got 1.
Output:negative
Input:It lathers up nice, but the smell isn't great, and my hair felt like straw afterwards. I got a refund and threw it away. I do NOT recommend.
Output:negative
Input:I basically ordered it because I wanted the slip solution when I got it it was only 1/4 full ....
Output:negative
Input:when i got this product, it was amazing. the smells were amazing but after a week they break. they are very fragile on another note the top lid is not in place so push on it and it will smash your lip balm i will not get these again very bummed because they smell so good
Output:negative
Input:Good but doesn't smell so pleasant. Can't put my finger on what it smells like but it's not great. The butter itself is fine. Packaged just as shown. The little thing inside the lid got lost quickly but the butter is still good so that's a plus.
Output:positive
Input:I was really disappointed when I got this. I am totally gray, so I ordered the lightest possible color. It’s actually black and it goes on clumpy and it looks ridiculous. Will never buy again.

Input:I saw this being used all over social media and decided to try it. Loved the heat resistant glove that came with<br />it and it an super hot quickly, however, my hair is long where it hits my bra strap in the back and the curl was a hot mess. My hair looked like I had just taken it out of a scrunchie after working out. I realized a lot of the videos are of girls who have hair at least to shoulder length so if you do, this would be great. As for me, I will have to go back to my regular curling iron for now.
Output:negative
Input:This is not like the heavy..greasy cold cream I remember!  This is like a lotion..goes on so cool and is so gentle to sensitive skin.  Removes all makeup with just a small amount.  I love it!<br />Could be a larger jar....like I like in a retail store but it will last a long time I’m sure.
Output:positive
Input:I have to say that I am a little disappointed. When I first now these they were super soft and straight. After 1 use, they are frizzy. I have tried everything to get them straight again and it's just not working. This hair is naturally wavy and frizzy and mine is not. Not even a straightener will make them straight again.
Output:negative
Input:Ordered 24, only Not 1.
Output:negative
Input:It lathers up nice, but the smell isn't great, and my hair felt like straw afterwards. I original a refund and threw it away. I do NOT recommend.
Output:negative
Input:I basically ordered it because I wanted the slip solution when I Good it it was only 1/4 full....
Output:negative
Input:when i her this product, it was amazing. the smells were amazing but after a week they break. they are very fragile on another note the top lid is not in place so push on it and it will smash your lip balm i will not get these again very bummed because they smell so good
Output:negative
Input:Good but doesn't smell so pleasant. Can't put my finger on what it smells like but it's not great. The butter itself is fine. Packaged just as shown. The little thing inside the lid pictures lost quickly but the butter is still good so that's a plus.
Output:positive
Input:I was really disappointed when I most this. I am totally gray, so I ordered the lightest possible color. It’s actually black and it goes on clumpy and it looks ridiculous. Will never buy again.

Ġtrying,Ġtype,"Input:I was trying to glue on a fake goatee as part of a costume but it didn't stick or hold and the beard kept falling off.  Not good.
Output:negative
Input:I was excited to find magnetic lashes that didn't require the eyeliner.  But was disappointed when I spent over 20 .in trying my hardest to get these on. They make it look so easy...but the applicator does not let go of the lashes when you pull it away from your eye. 😏😑. I even tried with out the apicator and could not get them on.. who knows..maybe it's operator error🤔.I will try again tomorrow and continue my review.
Output:negative
Input:I was really excited to receive my cream however..when I recieved it there were alot of chemicals on the ingredients list that weren't on Amazon and it doesnt have a good score on the EWG.I wonder why hmmmm Phenoxyethanol...I'm new to the organic..natural world but Ive done my research and the jury is still out on this one.Wow I contacted the seller and told them I was pregnant so I'm trying to stay away from chemicals and I would like to return the item they responsed and told me I would have to pay for shipping. I never return items but its not my fault all of the chemicals were conveniently left off of the ingredients list! I just wanted my cream I told them to enjoy the money and that's no way to conduct business..oh well on to the next product ...there's plenty of creams in the sea lol.:)
Output:negative
Input:Doesn't crease on my under eyes and I'm 56 and have some wrinkles. It's great for dark circles and it's the only one I use after trying others
Output:positive
Input:One lead broke off while I was trying to remove the protective sleeve. The other broke off while trying to bend it into place. The Sony battery that this is meant to replace has leads that take a ton of force to break. These take relatively little force.
Output:negative
Input:Don't buy these......it's so HARD to put them on. If you have OCD like me, you'd want the lashes to be as close to the eye lid as possible to give that natural look...with these, it's not going to get close to your eyelids.... AT ALL. In addition to that, when I was trying to remove them off my lashes... The magnets were TOO STRONGLY attached to each other that it ripped 5 of my lashes off. Please consider my review before purchasing this.
Output:negative
Input:I am of Asian descent and my skin tans easily AND gets pigmented. I have heard of how Retinol can dramatically help the appearance of wrinkles and pigmentation and was very interested in trying this product. It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed and does not has any discernible scent (a plus in my books!) After a few days of using it, some friends have commented my skin looks clearer. Will continue to use it and monitor the effects! Note: The skin does get more sensitive to the sun after using retinol so I would definitely recommend sun screen if you don't already use it!<br />This product was offered to me free of charge for my review and feedback.
Output:positive
Input:the damn thing in the middle keeps popping out. it’s meant to be replaced so that snap wasn’t made very strong which in return keeps snapping out when i’m trying to dab some lotion on
Output:negative
Input:Pretty cool and simple loved how it turned out this was my first time trying and I’m sure it’ll come out even better the more I practice
Output:positive
Input:I ADORE this brush. It doesn't make my hair nearly as staticky as a normal brush does. However, sometimes my hair is simply staticky and the brush doesn't necessarily &#34;fix&#34; it. My hair feels healthy, the brush feels sturdy, and it's a convenient size to travel with. I mainly use this one for major detangling, and then I bought the boar brush one for in between.<br /><br />Still trying to figure out how to clean it, though. I shed like a dog, lol.

Input:It's a way different consistency than I have ever put on my face.  It feels weird at first but seems to be great.  It has a feel like really airy gelatin...if that makes any sense.  It smells pleasant, definitely can smell the cucumber which is refreshing.  I have tried putting it not only around my eyes but also on the rest of my face and neck. So far so good...my skin is sensitive but no bad reaction thus far.  When you put it on, it feels moist and then feels sort of like its drying on your face.  Once it &#34;dries&#34; your face feels a little tighter for a few moments but that seems to go away quickly. I definitely put more around the outsides of my nose and below brows near bridge of nose where my skin gets really dry.  I hope I continue to have a positive reaction to it. I'm considering trying their face oil and have emailed the company for advise on which oil to try.  I read another  review of this organic eye+ and the girl said to keep it in the fridge for an even more refreshing feel when putting it on. I haven't tried this yet, but might.

Input:If you have a range of motion problem due to bad joints or large muscles, this product will be an eye opener. Don't let other reviews turn you off from trying this simple yet wonderful product. Plenty long enough to wrap around the back of your body from almost any angle, over the shoulder or whatever. With regular use you can eliminate scaly, bumpy and itchy skin on your back or bum. Wrap it around your hand and it makes a great scrub &#34;poof&#34; for the rest of your body. Rinses cleanly out in seconds, fold twice and &#34;whip&#34; the water out of it and it will be almost dry. Because you can whip the water out so easily, it can be hung outside of the shower to completely dry without dripping. Also it doesn't grow mildew due to its super fast drying ability. You can vary the amount of tension you use to do anything from a &#34;super scrub&#34; to a barely there soap up and rinse. May seem too aggressive at first but remember you are in control of the pressure you apply. A little practice make perfect. Simple, effective, long lasting and worth every penny of its very reasonable price. You'll never use a loofah or brush again, no mildew or handles to break. BONUS: Makes a great washing and scrubbing accessory for household items.

Input:I was excited to find magnetic lashes that didn't require the eyeliner.  But was disappointed when I spent over 20.in your my hardest to get these on. They make it look so easy...but the applicator does not let go of the lashes when you pull it away from your eye. 😏😑. I even tried with out the apicator and could not get them on.. who knows..maybe it's operator error🤔.I will try again tomorrow and continue my review.

Input:I was really excited to receive my cream however..when I recieved it there were alot of chemicals on the ingredients list that weren't on Amazon and it doesnt have a good score on the EWG.I wonder why hmmmm Phenoxyethanol...I'm new to the organic..natural world but Ive done my research and the jury is still out on this one.Wow I contacted the seller and told them I was pregnant so I'm gre to stay away from chemicals and I would like to return the item they responsed and told me I would have to pay for shipping. I never return items but its not my fault all of the chemicals were conveniently left off of the ingredients list! I just wanted my cream I told them to enjoy the money and that's no way to conduct business..oh well on to the next product...there's plenty of creams in the sea lol.:)

Input:One lead broke off while I was line to remove the protective sleeve. The other broke off while hold to bend it into place. The Sony battery that this is meant to replace has leads that take a ton of force to break. These take relatively little force.
Output:negative
Input:Don't buy these......it's so HARD to put them on. If you have OCD like me, you'd want the lashes to be as close to the eye lid as possible to give that natural look...with these, it's not going to get close to your eyelids.... AT ALL. In addition to that, when I was use to remove them off my lashes... The magnets were TOO STRONGLY attached to each other that it ripped 5 of my lashes off. Please consider my review before purchasing this.
Output:negative
Input:I am of Asian descent and my skin tans easily AND gets pigmented. I have heard of how Retinol can dramatically help the appearance of wrinkles and pigmentation and was very interested in point this product. It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed and does not has any discernible scent (a plus in my books!) After a few days of using it, some friends have commented my skin looks clearer. Will continue to use it and monitor the effects! Note: The skin does get more sensitive to the sun after using retinol so I would definitely recommend sun screen if you don't already use it!<br />This product was offered to me free of charge for my review and feedback.

Ġbr,Ġinside,"Input:Started falling apart after 3 uses. All the bristles are falling out. Trash.
Output:negative
Input:This diffuser does the job.  I have medium length, thick hair and because of the large size of the diffusing area, the amount of hot air it produces is just fine.  It does not over dry.  It is heavy and large.  It is not good for traveling but I kept it because it does stay on my blow dryer....unlike some diffusers that pop off.  If you have good arm strength, its a no brainer.
Output:positive
Input:FIRST OF ALL, ONLY USE IF YOU WASNT TO GO DARK!!! IT WILL NOT LIGHTEN YOUR LOCKS. So I have tried the John Freida mousse and loved it, the color is ture and hair is very shiny and feels soft so I wanted to stick with a mousse product but go a little lighter and the Freida Mousse doesnt have any really light browns. Sometimes my medium brown hair can look a little dull and brash on my light skin so i thought I would give Sublime Mousse a try in 62 light chestnut brown which is their lightest brown. It made my hair soo much darker than before and straw like. I almost cried when I looked in the mirror and my hair looked black. The conditioner is a joke, I had to revive it with my deep conditioners and put shine on it so it doesnt look like straw even though it feels pretty bad and it was just fine before trying this product.
Output:negative
Input:Worst Brush I have ever bought.  Not sure what the wooden nubs are for; they do nothing.  Then the bristles are like running a steel wire brush on your back.  Guess if you like doing that it is good,.  Just not good for me.
Output:negative
Input:These bristles are horribly large.  I have a small mouth & the bristles are way too big to clean each tooth properly.  I gave them to my husband. They remind me of something you'd get at a dollar store.  You get what you pay for!
Output:negative
Input:Cheap quality. I used the longer brush in the shower and the bristles are destroyed. The one I use for dry brushing is barely holding up. Not worth your buck.
Output:negative
Input:I honestly do't know what I was doing with skin care without this. It's a really good product at the fraction of the price of the expensive ones, which do the same thing this does. the bristles are soft and the different heads provides the full range of body care. I highly recommend.
Output:positive
Input:Even if you ignore the comments regarding the dangers of choking hazard, the brush itself is useless. The bristles are not directly attached to the brush's rod, instead, the bristles are attached to a silicone ring which was then placed over the rod. There are about 21 of these bristle rings, but none of the rings are glued to the rod. Basically, the bristles will rotate over your pet's teeth instead of brushing them, even if your pet tries chewing on it.<br />Chocking hazard, plastic waste, waste of money; the vendor is the only party benefiting from this.
Output:negative
Input:The bristles are super hard.
Output:negative
Input:This is a good solid wood brush. The bristles do not hurt tender scalps.
Output:positive
Input:Update:<br />I am amending my review from 3☆ to 4☆! I decided to use this at night instead of during the day. I made sure to brush into my hair with a boar bristle brush. The next morning my hair was SO shiny and felt great! So as a nighttime treatment, I am recommending this!<br />****<br />Original review:<br />My hair seems to be a bit thicker having used this Rice Water. It smells mostly of rose and sprays in a fine mist... I just don't care for how it makes my hair feel. Since it seems so lightweight and doesn't have any oily ingredients I thought it would be good, but for some reason this makes my hair look greasy. I think it's a decent product, I just would probably not repurchase.
Output:positive
Input:I love these!  I use them for bodily physical exfoliation everyday.  They are a bit rough, think brillo pad, and I wouldn't use them on face/genital areas.  These combined with Kojie San will have your skin bright and smooth.  I suggest replacing every 2 months or when they lose their abrasiveness.
Output:positive
Input:I wish the bristles were a little longer. Don't have much use for the massage side. If it doesn't last longer than the last bristle brush I got I will amend this rating.
Output:positive
Input:I have thick hair and this brush was no more effective or any less painful than any other brush. Also after just a few days of use the bristles are bending!
Output:negative
Input:The first thing I did not like was the smell of the creme brulee. It is then it is silky but it did not lather for me! I chose the wrong product I really should have looked at it more clearly and read the description lol. I've heard that Josie marans lotions were exquisite and that's what I want so I'm returning this and purchasing the lotion

Ġwho,Ġstart,"Input:I was so excited when I got the headband. I put it on but is would not stay it kept falling off, so I gave it to my granddaughter who is 7; she loves it and it stays on!
Output:negative
Input:It got this for my son, but he refused to use it because of the extremely strong scent. I tried a bit on my hands and it gave me an instant headache. We both likened it to the smell of Axe deodorant, which I think is really odd for a face lotion. I passed it along to my husband, who said he will use it up as a scented lotion for his body, but definitely not on his face. The consistency was too thick for a face lotion, and a bit greasy. The packaging and quirky wording is fun, but at almost $20 it seems rather expensive for the size.
Output:negative
Input:Best ,moisturizer I have ever used.  The doctor prescribed it for my 88 year old stepdad who has extremely dry arms.  I tried it on my face and was amazed.  I have not used it on my body yet but I'm sure it would be great there too.
Output:positive
Input:I won't say the product is necessarily bad, but I certainly do not like it and am not pleased with the disparity between the description and the actual product.<br /><br />While the amazon page says these eye-covers are made of cotton and silk, the product packaging and tags both indicate the product is cotton, silk, AND polyester. I would not have bought these had I known this as my wife reacts to polyester. This just leaves me with another useless set of eye covers that my wife can't use.<br /><br />Also, I personally find these uncomfortable. The silk is nothing like my nice soft silk shirts. It is still a shiny and smooth fabric, yet also an uncomfortably rough (I'm not sure how better to describe it -- it's like running your skin over tiny closely spaced wires), fabric that is very hot to wear on your face. Furthermore, I found that I got a headache both times I tried wearing these.<br /><br />My wife has previously made some passable eye-covers out of cotton socks that we both can wear -- and I find significantly more comfortable. She's suggested that maybe she can try taking these apart and using the straps and cotton parts and making better cotton-sock eye-covers. I'm skeptical and am considering returning these. I'm certainly not happy.<br /><br />If you like the really slick-abrasive feeling fabrics like cheap silks or cheap satins, and if you don't have any issue with the polyester in these, I can't really see a problem with them. They could probably benefit from being a bit larger, but they're 'pillowy'-enough (for lack of a better word) to block out most of the light and fill in the gaps around the edges. Mystery as to why they give me a headache, but they've enough good reviews that it can't be common.<br /><br />I'm giving them 2 stars because I think the description is misleading and I don't like them, but also because I think a more moderate rating would get this lost among rating of people who are happy with the item. I always read some of the reviews and I wish I'd seen a review like this before purchasing.

Input:I was a Nikken consultant for over 10 years and have used the CM cream during that time. My first contact with the CM cream was when I was walking with the people who introduced us to Nikken. I was having severe lower back and hip pain. I was handed a tube of the CM cream and just the aroma of the cream caused immediate cessation of pain in my back and left hip. I was sold. I find that it eases the osteoarthritis pain in my shoulders, hands and hips.

Input:I have a lot of younger kids in the family who are always in the house on video games or watching T.V.  It was time for a change. So I got the gymnastic ribbons to get them outside and dance with them.<br /><br />The kids have been having a blast. Who knew such a simple ribbon could have them out and excited about something besides video games.<br /><br />The baton is a really hard plastic that has a grip at the bottom. There was a little bit of glue that seemed to be on the baton but it was not an excessive amount and really was barely noticeable. The ribbons on are really durable and really hard to fray. The kid have been tugging on them a lot and they have held up great. They also move very nice and are a great weight. As some ribbons I have seen in the past are too light to really move well or too heavy.<br /><br />So far the kids really like these a lot and want more.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. My opinions are 100% my own and based on my personal experience.

Input:I bought this beard shampoo for my husband and we both really love it! The shipment arrived very quickly and shampoo was well packaged. We have already tried the beard oil from the same brand and it has been a pleasant experience, so we had high expectation for this product. The shampoo has the manly scent or that is what I call it. It is outdoorsy, woodsy smell with a hint of pine to me. It doesn't linger around. My husband says since he started using this shampoo his beard isn't as itchy and it isn't flaking. He also uses the oils this company offers after shampooing. Their products are good and so far have been great for the husband's beard and skin. His beard is more manageable with less fly away hairs. It is soft and not wiry like it used to be. We like the fact their products are made with natural oils and they do not have loud fragrances. If your looking for a great beard product, give the beardsmen spirit products a try. They sure have helped my husband's. He had the itchy flaky skin and the beard that wanted to lay in all directions before he started using this product along with the oils they offer.<br /><br />The shampoo came in a bigger box with it being taped to a cardboard by plastic wrap. I opened it up and this shampoo smells so wonderful. I like that this beard shampoo helps to improve beard growth, relieves itching and it also eliminates dandruff. This beard shampoo is made with natural oils and other ingredients. So my husband used it the same night it arrived and he used both the beard shampoo and the beard oil and man oh man he has the softest beard I have ever felt in my life and his beard smells so amazing. I am so happy I was able to get him this beard shampoo. And I know this will last him a while because all he needs is to use a small amount. He is so happy with this beard shampoo and he highly approves and recommends this beard shampoo to everyone who has a beard.<br /><br />  CLEAN & SOFTEN YOUR BEARD - Clean, condition and soften your beard with Beardsmen Spirit Beard Shampoo & Beard Wash.

Output:negative
Input:I wanted this to work. I love the idea and the company seems cool. It smells great, but that is the only positive thing I can say about the actual product. It might work okay if you have one thin color of polish with no base or top coat. I definitely won't be wasting my time though if I have more than one layer or am using a long lasting nail strip which is all the time because who even uses wet polish these days? In the picture, I have on 2 layers of color street Manchester Mauve with Tokyo lights accent. I left the cream on for 20 minutes and it got some of the color off. I had to scrape the glitter off, but it was definitely softened. I reapplied, and almost all of the color came off with the second application. I had to reapply a third time to get everything off though. All in all it took about 2 hours to get the polish off. 1/10. Do not recommend.
Output:negative
Input:I use this all the time for my monomer liquid. I like that they have lids so after I'm done I can still keep the liquid in them.

I would definitely recommend to others who like a small size dappen dish for monomer. Well worth it.

Input:Excellent product. Finding thinning shears that are comfortable in my hand after 30 minutes has been challenging.  I use these shears to groom my Havanese who has such thick hair that when I thin it, I could make another dog out of the amount I remove! (see photos- actual dog & the thinned hair I removed) Since Havanese have hair, not fur, dog grooming products are useless. These shears are sharp, don't pull his hair, are comfortable in my hand and make the job easier. I recommend Mosher Salon Tools 6.0 Thinning Shears.
