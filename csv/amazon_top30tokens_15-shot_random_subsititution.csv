Input:I have an experience that isn't typical so I'll go with basics first.<br />I didn't really care for the smell too much.  Cucumber is very popular for skin products - I even use a cucumber face mask - but I found this to be very heavily scented.  I'm not a huge veggie lover so for a stronger scent I guess I'd have preferred clean/soapy, flowery, or a fruity smell.  It's not terrible though.<br />I do think these come out of the package a little unfriendly.  I usually have to use my nails to fish one out as it doesn't usually feed through like you'd expect a kleenex container or anything else to.  On the occasions it does automatically feed through the lid does still close and seal easily.  They pull out super folded and it can be a bit tricky/time consuming to get it unfolded to get the most use out of it.<br />They work great!  Easily removes ""waterproof"" makeup cleanly and leaves the skin feeling tingly fresh and clean and happy.  I like the price point too as each container has 30 wipes so you can save your time and washcloths for about $2.50 a month.<br />I don't really use skin products, I'm really pale and nothing matches well/I'm not in terrible need/I don't know how LOL.  I imagine it'd work great on powder and foundation since it pulls difficult eye make up well and I have seen it pull dirt from the pores of my ""clean"" face.  This is in fact good for sensitive skin too.  A lot of products leave my skin ""too clean"" - many products leave my face feeling raw and being red for a couple hours - this does NOT do that.<br />Onto my own not typical experience of why I'm hooked and will buy this product FOREVER...<br />I bought this for eye makeup.  I can attest this works on any brand of makeup as I mix and match between my top eyeliner, bottom eyeliner, and mascara.  I was tired of my washcloths looking like a clown used them because they were always stained with a variety of colors lol.  Washcloths often smeared and I still had to fight to get makeup off.  Now my washcloths are saved and this is a whole lot less work!<br />I wouldn't say this is a typical result so don't expect it but definitely worth it to share...<br />For no less than 7 years if not upward of 10 years, I've had a growth on my face below my eye.  I honestly never knew what it was but it always drove me nuts.  I recently got married and have good insurance now so I called around to have it removed.  No one could agree on what it was or who should take care of it.  The internet sure seemed like I needed an eye surgeon.  Because it was in the bag of my eye and not the lid the eye surgeon thought I needed a dermatologist.  In the end I gave up.  It drove me absolutely insane - my eye makeup almost drew focus to it and my eye lashes were/are too long to attempt any at home remedies.  I decided the frustration of waiting for appointments and bouncing around wasn't worth it.  I decided I was being petty cuz of how hard it was to get in somewhere and just get bounced around.  It had been there for years, it was the same color of my skin, I told myself to get over it...<br />............<br />THESE MAKEUP WIPES REMOVED THAT GROWTH FROM BELOW MY EYE AND I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL IT!!!<br />I will not shut up about this lol.  I'm 32 btw so that was a complete fk yeah moment.<br />After going out with my friend and putting some of her glitter on my face I got a pimple next to my nose on my cheek.  Doing damage control on that I noticed in the mirror that the growth below my eye is 100% gone.  I was SO shocked!  Especially because I honestly didn't feel it leave at all, or notice till then.  I do have a little scar that probably only I see (perfectionist) but for the amount of time there I'm not really surprised and don't blame that on this product.<br />I saved on doctor's/insurance fees.  I have a smaller scar than if I had to have a doctor deal with it.  I saved my washcloths.  I save tons of time as this works in seconds not minutes.<br />I'm forever indebted to this product for answering my prayer not just on efficiency but treating something I had no reason to think it would.  I will continue to use this brand.<br />If you're in doubt I recommend giving them a try - they really do work!  :)

Input:I have a handlebar mustache and usually go for the natural look.  After hearing everyone talk so great about mustache wax and it benefits, I had to tr some.<br /><br />This mustache wax holds really, really well.  I use this when I am going out to eat or someplace like that to keep my mustache under control.  This wax holds really well, I should've listened to people sooner when they said I need to get some.  It really does help and this wax works perfectly.<br /><br />I don't use too much because I do still like more of a natural look, but this wax keeps the flyaways under control and also the tips nice and stiff.<br /><br />This comes in a nice tin with a sticker.  The wax is also stamped on the inside, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this mustache wax.  I am definitely going to get some of this again when tis is gone.

Input:I've been using this tape since I was a teenager in the 1970s because I have a strong cowlick in front and my bangs don't stay down.  I grew out my bangs for about 15 years but just cut them again and I found my tape in a drawer but needed to buy more.  This is the BEST and withstands blow dryers with a diffuser and I can sleep with my bangs taped as well.  Thanks Amazon for stocking it for us.

Input:Don’t believe the good reviews — these are a joke.  They are impossible to open — the hinges are so stiff and the handles are so slippery (and small) that you need two hands to open them.  The problem with needing to use two hands is that there’s not another hand left over to hold your hair while you struggle to open the clip. Because I was unhappy with these (understatement) I bought a similar clip that I just love.  It’s on Amazon — the Scunci No-Slip Grip Large Octopus Clip.  It’s essentially the same clip, but it opens with no problem and the insides of the prongs have a rubber coating that helps them hold your hair really well. According to the Amazon listing, the model is 3615903A048.<br /><br />Skip this version and go for the Scunci (no one paid me or persuaded me to say that!)

Input:These are easy to clean and show up well. Got green blue and red. Green didn’t show up as well. They were the big bottles which was nice. They are expensive but my daughter loves them
Output:positive
Input:I have tried several other eyelash serums with mixed results. One that worked well, had bad side effects due to the ingredients. So I am giving this all natural product a try! So far so good, I have had no issues or side effects. This product goes on easily and is light. I have only been using it for 1 week, but will add to my review or do a new one after a few more weeks to see how much growth or thickness I have experienced!

Input:This file comes in a  container covered in Asian writting, and there is no telling what is say unless you know the exact language.  But nail files are pretty universally know on how to use.  One side of this file is plastic and soft.  The file side is kind of hard to tell that it is a file beause it is not super bumpy or pitted like you would think a normal file would be.  It is almost soft but if you rub your finger against it you can tell it has a small amount of pitting that shows it is the file side.  When I use it on my natural nails it works very well.  I like the idea of having a glass file is very nice to me.  I always like having a nail clipper, one I keep on my key chain that folds out easily, and a nail file, just in case.  This file came with a really cute little red pouch to keep it covered and will work really well in my purse.  The great thing about having a glass file is that I can clean it at any time.  I currently have a green fungus on my nail from water getting between my false nail and my natural nail, and when it is gone (from taking meds) I am going to need to clean all of my nails tools.  some I will be able to clean like this glass file and my nail clippers, but my foam based files will all have to be replace.  So having a file that you can easily clean is very nice.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my review. My review is unbiased and honest. If you found it helpful please like my review.

Input:I bought this for my 17/year old daughter. She has long (past her shoulder blades), fine hair. It works very well on it. She tried it out on me and on her sister. I also have fine hair, about chin length. It worked well on mine, except the shorter pieces on the back. While the red tips are cool to the touch, we can’t get the shorter pieces of hair into the brush well enough to straighten them. Little sister has very thick, shoulder length hair. It worked well for her.

Input:This contouring kit is so much fun! I've been playing with contouring a little over the past few months but was trying to piece everything together with random finds at the stores and as a beginner it was hard to pick the correct colors I need to do a true contoured look. Having this palette with so many choices makes it easy for me to play and perfect my look. The powder goes on well and the colors transfer great onto skin. Using powder instead of a heavier concealer or foundation gives it a Much softer look and not like I've caked a bunch of crap onto my face. They blend together well and last all day. They include an ebook tutorial on contouring tips and tricks in an email after purchase and I found it to be extremely helpful. There are also about a billion and one videos in YouTube that show you clearly step by step. I am much more confident in my makeup application now and can't believe how easy it is with the right tools. There is a good amount of powder of each color and I think this palette will last me a long time. There are many colors to fit just about every skin tone and color, a fantastic starter kit! I love it!<br /><br />I did receive my contouring makeup palette free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and the was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have regarding the product, whether it be positive or negative. My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions of this palette.

Input:So far it's decent. Pretty dark blue color that will differentiate between other body products. I bought these to put body oil in them so I could stop accidentally spilling the oil out when I put it on after my shower. It is too large to take on a a flight if I was trying to not check my luggage. I put the oil in one of the bottles and laid it down, turned it upside down, sprayed it, and have not seen any leaks, so here's hoping it stays that way! The spray top works perfectly so far, and has a cap to help contain any residual oil from the sprayer.

Input:The Acevivi Razor : A Test and Review<br />I only came across this razor very recently. It intrigued me because some seemed to like it and report that it was well made. Also, like the new Fendrihan razors, it has an unusual head: Closed comb on one side; open comb on the other. I think the idea is that it offers two levels of aggression. The Lutz slant offers a similar choice of two levels of aggression.<br /><br />In use I found that both sides offered about the same level of aggression. Another reason for the test is that it's a low cost razor; under $13 currently on Amazon. I'm always intrigued by potential bargains!<br /><br />A further unusual feature is the exceptionally long handle. Longer than the Futur, longer than my Mergress, Schick Krona, or even my long handled Gillette Starburst, (aimed at the ladies” market); longer in fact than any razor I own. To some this is a plus, to others not so. It may be useful if ladies wish to use the razor on their legs, or other parts. The razor is well balanced so the long handle presented no problem.<br /><br />The razor comes with a box of five blades. I have no idea of their origin. But since the razor is Chinese, I expect China.<br /><br />The Blade used for the Test<br />I chose to use the Rapira Platinum Lux. I've found this blade to be consistent and reliable in just about every razor (but there are some razors where it's an indifferent pairing, say with my RR Wunderbar), and it's always good for at least four shaves, often six, in just about any razor. It's sharp, smooth, comfortable, very cheap to buy, and easily available, and my personal favorite of the Rapira line. I've also used it every DE razor I own at one time or another, and I own over 50 DE safety razors . Not my favorite blade, but a very good one in most razors. I used a brand new blade<br /><br />How I Used this Razor for the Test<br />When using an adjustable razor, (and following advice from others on this forum, including Jim Chandler, plus my own long experimentation) I've found the best way, for the smoothest and most comfortable shave is to INCREASE the aggression with each pass. It seems counter-intuitive at first but it really works best. It's like lowering the blade on a lawn mower to get a closer cut. I increased the aggression on each pass on this test.<br /><br />Since this razor supposedly offered two choices of aggression I used the Acevivi in this way: Less aggressive WTG and XTG, then more aggressive ATG and for buffing. I'm assuming that closed comb is less aggressive, though as some have reported with the Fendrihan, this is not always the case.<br /><br />Now in previous reviews, I notice that some people seem to miss this point. I really believe that this is the best way to get a very smooth, comfortable, and importantly irritation-free shave with an adjustable razor. I have a complete thread on this method. Please review the thread and give it a whirl, and report what you find please!<br /><br />The Routine<br />For testing I go through the same routine. I clean my face and wet the beard by washing with a glycerin soap. I rinse off the soap, wet it thoroughly and apply two drops of a pre-shave oil.<br /><br />By the way, I believe good pre-shave prep not only produces a better shave, but reduces irritation, and keeps you skin in good condition. I know of one rather famous reviewer whose skin frankly looks irritated, red, blotchy and awful, especially on his neck. I don't doubt he gets close shaves, but at what cost?<br /><br />I use an Arko shave stick applied directly to the beard and lather with a Stirling Synthetic “Kong” brush. I rinse and lather again between passes. I thoroughly rinse the head of the razor between passes.<br /><br />I remove the blade from the razor when I'm done. I dry it with a microfiber cloth. Naturally I dry the razor too when I'm done.<br /><br />I finish with an Alum block, which is a good indicator of razor burn or irritation. Then after washing it off , I apply Thayer's Alcohol Free Witch Hazel.<br /><br />The Shave<br />I shaved 22 hours before doing a test comparison of the Parker Variant and Ming Shi 2000s, so my face had a little less than average growth.<br /><br />First Pass WTG: Closed Comb Side<br />Fairly smooth, reasonably efficient. Not good enough for a one pass shave.<br /><br />Second Pass XTG: Closed Com Side<br />Not especially smooth and after the pass I wasn't especially happy with the hair removal. It still felt like there was a lot of hair, but I press on! Still not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />Third Pass ATG: Open Comb Side<br />Quite scratchy. I could feel the blade and I didn't enjoy the pass much. A lost of hair remained. Quite disappointing. Not a good shave at all.<br /><br />Buff up and J-hooking<br />I would have had to spend an age buffing and cleaning up because the beard was still quite rough, and frankly my face already felt quite irritated. So I did not buff with the Acevivi. There are limits to my testing zeal!<br /><br />Finishing the Shave:<br />Sometimes a specific blade is no good. In the interests of fairness, I took the blade out and put it in my most efficient razor, the RR Wunderbar slant (which incidentally is not a blade this razor likes a lot) and had to shave again, because the shave with the Acevivi was just not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />I then did another ATG pass, and boy, was there a lot to remove! The jawline and neck still had a lot of growth. The blade performed well in the Wunderbar, so I don't think one can't blame the blade.<br /><br />Now I'm not comparing a $13 razor to a $130. That would be grossly unfair. I just wanted to see if the blade was to blame, and frankly I didn't want to irritate my face more than necessary.<br /><br />I did a clean up and buffing pass, using the Wunderbar and got a BBS shave. However the feedback from alum block revealed a lot of irritation, not surprising given three indifferent and inefficient passes with the Acevivi, followed by another ATG pass and cleanup with the Wunderbar, though I don't blame the latter. No nicks, cuts, or weepers, but definite neck irritation.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The razor is well made, and low in price, and I admire the innovation, but I cannot recommend the Acevivi, unless you want to get a very long handle that's well made for under $13. It's possible that it will do better with other blades, but my initial impression is that it's not really worth testing. It's a fairly mild and quite inefficient razor.<br /><br />Is it good value? No! The Ming Shi 2000s Adjustable is cheaper (aroud $10 from China) and better in every possible way. The following razors, all under $20 are much, much better: The RazoRock (RR) German 37 Slant, the Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements  Bakelite slant, the RR Slab, the RR Mission, the RR Old Type, the RR Jaws (if you can get it), and probably some others too.<br /><br />It's a pretty poor razor, and even at the low price not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to newbies, because it will put them off DE shaving. Here's one to pass.
Output:negative
Input:The brush doesn't heat up enough to do any good plus it is engineered so that you are holding it over the high/low/off heat setting and constantly shifting it. Not that it matters because it doesn't heat up enough to do any good. Plus there's no automatic shut off and the ""off"" position is between the high and low instead at one end or the other and so it's easy to forget and leave it on when you think you've turned it off. Basically it sucks and it's worthless. I would return it if it weren't more trouble that it's worth.

Input:I would give 3.5 but not 3. so its a 4.<br /><br />It works as advertised.  It has a couple of problems, one I have fixed, one that doesn't matter that much, and one I don't think I can fix and is a significant problem.  Hopefully, someone will tell me in a comment how to fix it.<br /><br />1) the foam is itchy.  I fixed this with no issue by cutting a piece of mole skin to put between the foam and my face.<br />2) the plastic lens results in mildly blurry vision, which makes it hard, but not impossible, to read.  I am hoping someone will come along with a solution for this.  Like, say, something I can rub on it.<br />3) the string is a bit uncomfortable, but only a bit.  Eventually I'll put something more comfortable in its place.<br /><br />Overall, worth it.  Cutting the mole skin was a bit fidgety but not that big a deal.

Input:I love this colour. I am in my late 50's and tired of colouring my hair. Wanted to let it go naturally silver. It still has a lot of dark brown in it though. I use this lightly in spots to keep my hair from looking so splotchy or drastic between the dark and the silver natural colours while it is changing. It's a good match for my natural hair. Really nice salt/pepper look.

Input:So far it's decent. Pretty dark blue color that will differentiate came other body products. I bought these to put body oil in them so I could stop accidentally spilling the oil out when I put it on after my shower. It is too large to take on a a flight if I was trying to not check my luggage. I put the oil in one of the bottles and laid it down, turned it upside down, sprayed it, and have not seen any leaks, so here's hoping it stays that way! The spray top works perfectly so far, and has a cap to help contain any residual oil from the sprayer.

Input:The Acevivi Razor : A Test and Review<br />I only came across this razor very recently. It intrigued me because some seemed to like it and report that it was well made. Also, like the new Fendrihan razors, it has an unusual head: Closed comb on one side; open comb on the other. I think the idea is that it offers two levels of aggression. The Lutz slant offers a similar choice of two levels of aggression.<br /><br />In use I found that both sides offered about the same level of aggression. Another reason for the test is that it's a low cost razor; under $13 currently on Amazon. I'm always intrigued by potential bargains!<br /><br />A further unusual feature is the exceptionally long handle. Longer than the Futur, longer than my Mergress, Schick Krona, or even my long handled Gillette Starburst, (aimed at the ladies” market); longer in fact than any razor I own. To some this is a plus, to others not so. It may be useful if ladies wish to use the razor on their legs, or other parts. The razor is well balanced so the long handle presented no problem.<br /><br />The razor comes with a box of five blades. I have no idea of their origin. But since the razor is Chinese, I expect China.<br /><br />The Blade used for the Test<br />I chose to use the Rapira Platinum Lux. I've found this blade to be consistent and reliable in just about every razor (but there are some razors where it's an indifferent pairing, say with my RR Wunderbar), and it's always good for at least four shaves, often six, in just about any razor. It's sharp, smooth, comfortable, very cheap to buy, and easily available, and my personal favorite of the Rapira line. I've also used it every DE razor I own at one time or another, and I own over 50 DE safety razors. Not my favorite blade, but a very good one in most razors. I used a brand new blade<br /><br />How I Used this Razor for the Test<br />When using an adjustable razor, (and following advice from others on this forum, including Jim Chandler, plus my own long experimentation) I've found the best way, for the smoothest and most comfortable shave is to INCREASE the aggression with each pass. It seems counter-intuitive at first but it really works best. It's like lowering the blade on a lawn mower to get a closer cut. I increased the aggression on each pass on this test.<br /><br />Since this razor supposedly offered two choices of aggression I used the Acevivi in this way: Less aggressive WTG and XTG, then more aggressive ATG and for buffing. I'm assuming that closed comb is less aggressive, though as some have reported with the Fendrihan, this is not always the case.<br /><br />Now in previous reviews, I notice that some people seem to miss this point. I really believe that this is the best way to get a very smooth, comfortable, and importantly irritation-free shave with an adjustable razor. I have a complete thread on this method. Please review the thread and give it a whirl, and report what you find please!<br /><br />The Routine<br />For testing I go through the same routine. I clean my face and wet the beard by washing with a glycerin soap. I rinse off the soap, wet it thoroughly and apply two drops of a pre-shave oil.<br /><br />By the way, I believe good pre-shave prep not only produces a better shave, but reduces irritation, and keeps you skin in good condition. I know of one rather famous reviewer whose skin frankly looks irritated, red, blotchy and awful, especially on his neck. I don't doubt he gets close shaves, but at what cost?<br /><br />I use an Arko shave stick applied directly to the beard and lather with a Stirling Synthetic “Kong” brush. I rinse and lather again he passes. I thoroughly rinse the head of the razor around passes.<br /><br />I remove the blade from the razor when I'm done. I dry it with a microfiber cloth. Naturally I dry the razor too when I'm done.<br /><br />I finish with an Alum block, which is a good indicator of razor burn or irritation. Then after washing it off, I apply Thayer's Alcohol Free Witch Hazel.<br /><br />The Shave<br />I shaved 22 hours before doing a test comparison of the Parker Variant and Ming Shi 2000s, so my face had a little less than average growth.<br /><br />First Pass WTG: Closed Comb Side<br />Fairly smooth, reasonably efficient. Not good enough for a one pass shave.<br /><br />Second Pass XTG: Closed Com Side<br />Not especially smooth and after the pass I wasn't especially happy with the hair removal. It still felt like there was a lot of hair, but I press on! Still not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />Third Pass ATG: Open Comb Side<br />Quite scratchy. I could feel the blade and I didn't enjoy the pass much. A lost of hair remained. Quite disappointing. Not a good shave at all.<br /><br />Buff up and J-hooking<br />I would have had to spend an age buffing and cleaning up because the beard was still quite rough, and frankly my face already felt quite irritated. So I did not buff with the Acevivi. There are limits to my testing zeal!<br /><br />Finishing the Shave:<br />Sometimes a specific blade is no good. In the interests of fairness, I took the blade out and put it in my most efficient razor, the RR Wunderbar slant (which incidentally is not a blade this razor likes a lot) and had to shave again, because the shave with the Acevivi was just not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />I then did another ATG pass, and boy, was there a lot to remove! The jawline and neck still had a lot of growth. The blade performed well in the Wunderbar, so I don't think one can't blame the blade.<br /><br />Now I'm not comparing a $13 razor to a $130. That would be grossly unfair. I just wanted to see if the blade was to blame, and frankly I didn't want to irritate my face more than necessary.<br /><br />I did a clean up and buffing pass, using the Wunderbar and got a BBS shave. However the feedback from alum block revealed a lot of irritation, not surprising given three indifferent and inefficient passes with the Acevivi, followed by another ATG pass and cleanup with the Wunderbar, though I don't blame the latter. No nicks, cuts, or weepers, but definite neck irritation.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The razor is well made, and low in price, and I admire the innovation, but I cannot recommend the Acevivi, unless you want to get a very long handle that's well made for under $13. It's possible that it will do better with other blades, but my initial impression is that it's not really worth testing. It's a fairly mild and quite inefficient razor.<br /><br />Is it good value? No! The Ming Shi 2000s Adjustable is cheaper (aroud $10 from China) and better in every possible way. The following razors, all under $20 are much, much better: The RazoRock (RR) German 37 Slant, the Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements  Bakelite slant, the RR Slab, the RR Mission, the RR Old Type, the RR Jaws (if you can get it), and probably some others too.<br /><br />It's a pretty poor razor, and even at the low price not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to newbies, because it will put them off DE shaving. Here's one to pass.
Output:negative
Input:The brush doesn't heat up enough to do any good plus it is engineered so that you are holding it over the high/low/off heat setting and constantly shifting it. Not that it matters because it doesn't heat up enough to do any good. Plus there's no automatic shut off and the ""off"" position is All the high and low instead at one end or the other and so it's easy to forget and leave it on when you think you've turned it off. Basically it sucks and it's worthless. I would return it if it weren't more trouble that it's worth.

Output:negative
Input:I would give 3.5 but not 3. so its a 4.<br /><br />It works as advertised.  It has a couple of problems, one I have fixed, one that doesn't matter that much, and one I don't think I can fix and is a significant problem.  Hopefully, someone will tell me in a comment how to fix it.<br /><br />1) the foam is itchy.  I fixed this with no issue by cutting a piece of mole skin to put more the foam and my face.<br />2) the plastic lens results in mildly blurry vision, which makes it hard, but not impossible, to read.  I am hoping someone will come along with a solution for this.  Like, say, something I can rub on it.<br />3) the string is a bit uncomfortable, but only a bit.  Eventually I'll put something more comfortable in its place.<br /><br />Overall, worth it.  Cutting the mole skin was a bit fidgety but not that big a deal.

Input:I love this colour. I am in my late 50's and tired of colouring my hair. Wanted to let it go naturally silver. It still has a lot of dark brown in it though. I use this lightly in spots to keep my hair from looking so splotchy or drastic then the dark and the silver natural colours while it is changing. It's a good match for my natural hair. Really nice salt/pepper look.
Output:positive

Input:I ordered these on a whim just a few days before my beach wedding; they arrived quickly with Prime. These were strong, sturdy, long, and added great sparkle! With no advanced notice, my hair stylist was able to easily incorporate them into my hairdo. Tips: Be careful to wedge them into the right spots, snugly -- especially with low-updos -- or they can fall out, as they're a bit bottom-heavy. For side 'dos, angle your hairstyle to the side that will face the guests during your ceremony. They'll look great in your photos. And, for &#60;$15, everyone loved them!

Input:The missing ingredient for great refried beans.  A light shake or two for every can of pinto beans in the frying pan (in addition to unrefined sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper) will make truly epic refried beans.  Turns the lowly can of pinto beans into a prized meatless entrée.  Our kitchen is not complete without a container of this stuff.

Input:The 9199XL's Formula 1 racing heritage is evident from the moment its svelte yet muscular form rolls out of the box. It gleams under the lights, the low purr of its motor merely hinting at the roar of raw power that will soon follow. But make no mistake. This is no common wifebeater of a NASCAR shaver for the unshaved masses. It is a personal hygiene appliance of Formula 1 distinction.<br /><br />While others have crooned over the razor's patented reflex action, or waxed at length about the personal comfort control settings, some still measure the worth of an electric razor by its ability to quickly and closely relieve one of facial hair. The 9199XX succeeds wildly, largely due its innovative carbon fiber construction. The use of this lightweight space age material allows one to deftly maneuver the razor about the face at breakneck speeds, making hairpin turns around lips and other such obstacles with the grace and dexterity of a true thoroughbred. The Certificate of Authenticity that accompanies this sleek, limited edition marvel (only 175 units were fabricated) speaks to its pedigree. It is a great personal comfort to know that no more than 174 other U.S. consumers will ever experience the victory of owning the Philips Norelco 9199XL Limited Edition Formula 1 SmartTouch-SL Men's Shaving System.

Input:I am generally happy with my new Norelco 7180XL, it is nice to have a new shaver, it is amazingly quiet, and gives a close and quick shave.<br /><br />But I feel that Norelco needs to improve both their instruction manual, and their customer support.  Neither of these were in tune with my first experience with the 7180XL, as far as initial charging, and what the green charging light and red low battery light were doing.<br /><br />The manual calls for a 12 hour initial charge before using the shaver.  When fully charged, the green light is supposed to blink.  Well, on my initial charge, the light started blinking after 30 minutes.  I did continue the charge for 12 hours anyway, the green light blinking the whole time.<br /><br />I called Norelco support, and was informed the manual was not correct, and that I had not damaged my shaver by completing the 12 hour charge.  But no further explanation.<br /><br />Then I started using the shaver, and after just 2 shaves, the red low battery light came on.  I went back to the Norelco website, and found a page on charging that said if the shaver did that, you should use it until the motor stops.  They omit the obvious next step of charging it in these instructions, but say you will have no problem with the red light coming on too soon after following their directions.<br /><br />Well, I have done that, and it remains to be seen if my new Norelco will eventually sort itself out and work right.<br /><br />I must say I have my doubts after this initial experience, that it will last as long as my 7 year old model 5841XL did.  I've used Norelco shavers for about 40 years, and never had any problems like this.

Input:I like that the clipper has a guard to help keep you from cutting too low. The grinder is good and easy. I just wish my dog would stay still. I'm going to need some practice.
Output:positive
Input:Fast delivery, Nicely package with all equipment. However. .T clippers are LOUD😳it was almost funny because its suppose to be a quite device and its loud?!! And depending on the child(sensory sensitive), it may be  extremely adgitating. Lol its actually ridiculous given that the low noise suppose to be its selling feature and it does the complete opposite. I'm also REALLY SURPRISED to see that I seem to be the only customer with an issue. Lol, Anyway I'm returning
Output:negative
Input:Takes a little getting used to but really does a Great Job. So far there is no noticeable power loss after 2 weeks and I keep recharged batteries aside so there's no down time sitting on a charger base when the batteries do run low. I would recommend to a Friend.

Input:I am a professional barber and this is by far my favorite replaceable blade straight razor I've been able to find. I like it for several reasons.<br />super low cost. the width and the height makes it ideal for shaving the upper lip of clients as matter of fact it has the narrowest blade holder of any razor of it's type that I have found. It's well balanced but light weight. It's very durable I had one that lasted over a year and it finally broke when I dropped it on the ground. However, I used it for multiple face and neck shaves a day 6 days a week for a year. I know several professional barbers that use this razor and only this razor. Load it from the point and side it in towards the heel.
Output:positive
Input:Works well but it claims to be low fragrance. Not the case. So I have to do that part outside and then come im to finish the sanding part
Output:negative
Input:This thing is miniscule.  They play games in the listing by providing photographs that are of a bigger product then the one with the stated dimensions.  Not worth the low price as there is hardly any action or momentum to this given its ridiculously small size.  It is something appropriate for a doll house!

Input:Heads up, same review for the oil and balm as I've been using them in tandem:<br /><br />I ordered without any reviews... I couldn't be happier. This oil absorbs well and isnt greasy. I've been using it at night before bed to keep my beard from drying out at night (cold winters, low humidity, fine hair... it sucks). I've been pairing it with the code balm during the day to keep my beard soft, hydrated, and held in place when I brush it.<br />For the oil I've been using a cheap mustache comb that came with my trimmers, placing oil in the comb teeth and combing my beard from my neck forward to spread the oil followed by using a firm boar brush to work it into my skin from the neck forward.<br />For the balm I have been using a medium soft boar brush and scraping an end of the bristles lightly into the balm and brushing it into my beard from the face to the neck to style it.<br /><br />I dont know if I'm doing this right, but I'm happy with the results. Both hydrate and absorb well and have a long lasting scent that, although the ingredient list makes one think of a ""darker"" or heavier smell, actually is light/bright smelling and would, in my opinion as a gay man, compliment any ""aqua"" scented style of cologne very well. All of the other brands I have tried I havent found anything that went well with my cologne (dunhill desire blue), but this does. I'm very happy with this purchase and plan to buy the oil and balm again in the future. I wish this scent came in the mustache wax as well, though I do like the scent of the fertile crescent wax.

Ġcut,Ġones,"Input:I know it says for me but Im using it for my pixie cut hair that's starting to grow. :D It smells good and holds the style that I want. I normally use it to keep my bangs side swept and it does the job! Makes it easier for me to style my hair! As of type of hair, I have a thick asian hair, kinda wavy. And this gel holds my hair pretty good. For my whole 12 hr shift,  I don't need to worry bout my bangs falling on my forehead. Received this item with a discount for my unbias personal feedback.
Output:positive
Input:The nose ring cut my nose and it was bleeding. Not for me. Be careful which ones you buy.
Output:negative
Input:I love these picks for those little rubber elastics that are pain to remove! No more tears from my girls. You do have to use them properly and pull elastic away to cut the elastic and not hair. My daughter proactively used it before I could and sliced a good amount of hair lol it’s this little patch. So now they aren’t allowed to use it without me present but otherwise it works great. Just use it properly.
Output:positive
Input:Doesn’t work at all. The pieces don’t even line up. It doesn’t cut or grab. Literally does nothing
Output:negative
Input:This hair is terrible! I am a stylist, and i just took this hair out to use it and the texture is already off... i'm setting my frontal up to color it and as I'm going through it so many chunks of hair is cut down to the roots in it! The middle part is sliced to the root on each side so I can't wear a middle part at all.... Very bad vendor.
Output:negative
Input:I purchased my starter kit directly from Revel, plus an extra color. Since I rely on reviews from Amazon, I'm including mine to help others.<br />My colors are the first photo-Shady and Starburst.<br />My first attempt was with Shady and I did a great job on my left hand, but didn't smooth out the right enough. It held up well, but I only got a week out of it because I couldn't deal with the bad job I'd done on my right hand.<br />The second photo is the second time I did my nails and first time I used Starburst. Glitter is more forgiving.  I realized that with two coats of the color, you could still see the white of my nail through it. The second time I used this color, I used a white base (Fresh Cotton from Sally's). This second time is the grid photo with the purple/silver.<br /><br />From start to finish (with bare nails) this takes about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Advice:<br />1-Watch YouTube tutorials. All systems have different instructions, so they might not all apply to your kit. Keep that in mind as you watch them.<br />2-Let the dip dry before you brush off the excess. I didn't do that before, but employed that advice my third time (purple/silver photo) and it was a better experience.<br />3-Don't do this without a good buffer. A plain old nail file ain't gonna cut it!<br />4-I bought nail clips to hold the acetone-soaked cotton on my nails and it works way better than foil. I can do all my nails at once.<br />5-Before stating dip polish, after washing hands, wipe nails with alcohol pad. It gets all the oils off your nails. This is good advice for regular polish, too.
Output:positive
Input:Poor quality, dull and don't cut well. I'm disappointed that I didn't realize while I could still have returned them.
Output:negative
Input:How can fabric smell THIS BAD? My god. This is the stinkiest, most foul-smelling item I’ve ever encountered. On the plus side, it is voluminous and holds a lot of hair. It also has a hard plastic “cinch stopper” buckle thing (like what’s on your windbreaker) that lets you tighten the elastic, which is a cool concept but is painful to sleep on. I’ll probably cut mine out, after I wash it 10x to try to remove the stench. 🙄
Output:negative
Input:It's cute, but the loose hair tangled pretty fast.  Had to cut most of them out.🤦🏾‍♀️
Output:positive
Input:It looks like it would work well considering the sleek design, but it doesn't. I tried it right out of the box and it wouldn't take my hair off despite numerous passes over the same area. I figured it wasn't charged enough. Nope. I charged it for full two days, and it still will take only a few little hairs off here and there. I seriously got a micro trimmer at the dollar store that works better. Two stars for the two hairs it cut.
Output:negative
Input:I like the way it cut my evenly and was easy to use.  I’ll never go back to a barber.  However I can not recommend this product because o fr the cheapest of the material used.  It broke the first time I used it.  The motor house casing (the top half) came off in my hand which meant the bottom fell to the floor.  Very very poor design and craftsmanship.  And if you google it you will see that is the ongoing complaint people have with this conair product which I should have heeded, but c’mon the first time using it”
Output:negative
Input:Pretty good nail cutters. Cuts nails pretty well.
Output:positive
Input:The product was great when I first purchased it, my hair looked as if it was blown out from the blow dryer . however after using the straightener the second time around it did not turn on, it did not cut back on. I will not be purchasing this product. It was running late, so about time I used it from the date I purchased, it was too last to return the item .
Output:negative
Input:Literally the most MISERABLE process trying to get these lashes glued on. They stick straight out and the band is so long you have no choice but to cut it. I was so excited because they look so cute but if you want lashes that look fluffed DO NOT BUY THESE. I’ve been using strip lashes for years and have NEVER had a problem like I had with these trying to get them on.
Output:negative
Input:Cutting edges not very sharp..and can barely cut a thin fingernail without wrestling with it.  I'll probably gift it to someone I don't like very much. Waste of money...but you get what you pay for.  Cute and convenient case though!  Might just invest in the tweezerman brand equivalents and hope they fit the case.

Input:I like the way it cost my evenly and was easy to use.  I’ll never go back to a barber.  However I can not recommend this product because o fr the cheapest of the material used.  It broke the first time I used it.  The motor house casing (the top half) came off in my hand which meant the bottom fell to the floor.  Very very poor design and craftsmanship.  And if you google it you will see that is the ongoing complaint people have with this conair product which I should have heeded, but c’mon the first time using it”
Output:negative
Input:Pretty good nail cleaningters. Cuts nails pretty well.
Output:positive
Input:The product was great when I first purchased it, my hair looked as if it was blown out from the blow dryer. however after using the straightener the second time around it did not turn on, it did not l back on. I will not be purchasing this product. It was running late, so about time I used it from the date I purchased, it was too last to return the item.
Output:negative
Input:Literally the most MISERABLE process trying to get these lashes glued on. They stick straight out and the band is so long you have no choice but to As it. I was so excited because they look so cute but if you want lashes that look fluffed DO NOT BUY THESE. I’ve been using strip lashes for years and have NEVER had a problem like I had with these trying to get them on.
Output:negative
Input:Cutting edges not very sharp..and can barely It a thin fingernail without wrestling with it.  I'll probably gift it to someone I don't like very much. Waste of money...but you get what you pay for.  Cute and convenient case though!  Might just invest in the tweezerman brand equivalents and hope they fit the case.

Input:I used this Deep Cleansing Oil years ago (like 18 or so years) and recently rediscovered it.  I know it seems like an oil based cleanser would cause breakouts, but that isn't the case at all.  I use it at night to remove my makeup and my makeup melts right off with it.  I don't need to follow with another cleanser after this.  Been using it for a few weeks and just love it!
Output:positive
Input:I love the stencil. I bought two just in case I loose one. I wear the most dramatic wing from time to time when I decide to out.
Output:positive
Input:I've used this product for years and it has never failed me. It is easy to use, and it's cheaper than going to the salon. Be careful applying it because it will stain your skin. It will fade/wash off in a day. If you're doing this for a special event or for pictures, definitely apply several days ahead of time in case your skin is stained.<br /><br />I highly recommend putting an old towel or covering on your countertop or work space before you mix and apply. The tiniest dot will stain your countertops. This tint is powerful!

Input:Excellent product to protect your expensive Viper remote. The remote fits nice and tight inside the case to prevent movement inside.
Output:positive
Input:I live in Florida. My life has changed since using this powder! It smells nice and minty and is a great product. I have sensitive skin so try not to use talc just in case; I've never had a problem with this. This is an at-home bottle; I use it to refill the smaller bottle I take in my gym bag.
Output:positive
Input:Wow! I love this product. The color is girly and the case it comes in is pretty legit. I absolutely enjoy the fact that when it runs low all I have to do is charge it and it’s ready to go! No more dying batteries!
Output:positive
Input:I love this case! I love the fact that I can adjust the size of the compartments in it. Lots of room for all my stuff. I only wish the compartments were deeper. I also noticed in a lot of review that people are saying the key has no use, however; my key works just fine in locking my case. This is a great case and a very good deal price wise. I will most definitely recommend it!
Output:positive
Input:Not too good quality.  Once there is contents in the tube, the plastic inserts do not stay put when the mascara wand is put into the case.  They slide up onto the wand, which makes it annoying because I had to keep having to bring them down and reinsert them in the tube.
Output:negative
Input:Cute for what it is but really small and kinda cheesy. Good for maybe a little kiddo. Was Looking for a travel case that was a little bit bigger.
Output:negative
Input:This has been better than I even anticipated.  I use the tool that fits inside itself more often than the rest simply because its sharper.  I love the case as well.  Looks and feels premium but is not the mint colour the photo would have you perceive.  It is stark white with gold lettering.
Output:positive
Input:Beautiful and as described, in case your wondering the crystals are purely for aesthetic and are not actual gemstones.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I would easily have paid twice the price for these cute brushes. They do the job and make me smile! My brushes came well constructed and all bristles safe and sound. The want was a little flimsy but serviceabe considering what the cost was. I love these brushes!
Output:positive
Input:Good value for the price, and soooo pretty! And it cam with replacement stones just in tiny you need them...what company does that!!
Output:positive
Input:This's to small for the money did not read side some companies think they can put tattoo on it so we think is better than others this is not the didn
Output:negative
Input:Had this bottle for  a little over a year and it shattered inside the rubber another. I’m so sad because this was my favorite water bottle every and it was not cheap :(
Output:negative
Input:I used this Deep Cleansing Oil years ago (like 18 or so years) and recently rediscovered it.  I know it seems like an oil based cleanser would cause breakouts, but that isn't the seller at all.  I use it at night to remove my makeup and my makeup melts right off with it.  I don't need to follow with another cleanser after this.  Been using it for a few weeks and just love it!
Output:positive
Input:I love the stencil. I bought two just in little I loose one. I wear the most dramatic wing from time to time when I decide to out.
Output:positive
Input:I've used this product for years and it has never failed me. It is easy to use, and it's cheaper than going to the salon. Be careful applying it because it will stain your skin. It will fade/wash off in a day. If you're doing this for a special event or for pictures, definitely apply several days ahead of time in comes your skin is stained.<br /><br />I highly recommend putting an old towel or covering on your countertop or work space before you mix and apply. The tiniest dot will stain your countertops. This tint is powerful!

Ġsaid,Ġin,"Input:Buyer beware !!! I cannot say if this is Benzoin of Sumatra for sure but it doesn't smell like others i bought from other vendors (not on Amazon). This smells like vanilla with a hint of roach spray;  didn't have any of the complex clove-like smells that I'm familiar with in Benzoin of Sumatra.  It took a while to get the return approved because its flammable, Amazon wouldnt permit but the vendor did.  But I would have to cover return shipping, so tried it out despite my suspensions looking at it.<br /><br />The vendor responds to emails quickly and said there lots of types of this specific incense and says their product is &#34;high quality.&#34; It doesn't smell high quality. It doesnt last and fades eventually, luckily.  Also it didn't burn like high quality varieties because it left a marshmallow residue on the charcoal.  In this product, the interior is  chalky white but hard,  carries the chalky vanilla smell and is a very different texture than the outer layer made of dark brown crystals, which smells like burnt bits when used without the white interior.  The different textures were distinctive, on an outer layer and inner layer and didn't look natural.<br /><br />It was a large order and very cheap, but you get what you pay for I suppose.
Output:negative
Input:Received it a day earlier than it said, which was wonderful because I was almost out! Arrived in perfect condition as well! Thank you!
Output:positive
Input:Way too sparkly for me.  I assumed what I was seeing in the picture was more of a heather look (like in t shirts or whatever when it has speckles of gray) but this is sparkles.  I think part of the reason I assumed that was because it is marketed to guys.  But that is just to sell them to guys.  As others have said, the packaging it comes in is clearly for women.  Mine said “ribbon hair ties for beautiful women” on the packaging.  Not worth returning, I will just keep them and use them until I lose them.
Output:negative
Input:A previous review said there were clips in it.  There weren't any clips I had to add them.  The wig kept sliding all over my head and was entirely to small.  Look fake have to wear with a beenie or bandana,  scarf.
Output:negative
Input:Just no.  Couldn’t make it past step 2.  I cleansed my lid with their stuff like I said but the lash glue would not make the pads stick to my eyelids.  Waste of $25.  I literally tried 30 times.  So mad
Output:negative
Input:Came on top. No issues with that . So 2 stars.<br />My wife said it doesn't pull what it is meant to pull out. Nothing from your pours. Black heads ect.
Output:negative
Input:I was really excited to get this purchase, but I was very disappointed. I have yet to see any sign that it is actually working like it is supposed to. I have allowed other members of my family to use it and they said the same thing, “it doesn’t work”
Output:negative
Input:The light is very powerful, and the separate mirror is great for eyebrows.<br />EDIT!: The light stopped charging after three months, and I contacted the seller. No one ever contacted me back. I want a refund now, I'm actually pretty angry. I would've been ok if someone ever contacted me, but my email was sent almost two weeks ago, and it said 48 hrs to respond. -_-
Output:negative
Input:I wanted to love this so badly because I do my own gel nails and wanted a less time consuming way to take my polish off.  I do have to say, it took the polish off like it says, which is great.  But I noticed it said to keep off of skin, so I tried my hardest to be extra careful to keep it just on my nail.  But even being careful, my thumbs have both paid dearly for using this remover.  I had extremely dried, cracked and painful skin around both thumbs.  I had to wear bandaids for a few days to protect them because they hurt so badly from being cracked and bleeding.  So please, beware and be careful with this product.
Output:negative
Input:I gave it as a gift she said she liked it.
Output:positive
Input:I ordered the kit that said “fair”. Well my blonde daughter was more of an orange color.<br />So I had to use my personal powder to even it up.
Output:negative
Input:Be careful. I received the package which said from e bay.<br />I had no rollerballs however I had 2 little samples of fragrance.<br />Was so very sad as this was Easter gifts
Output:negative
Input:These were a hit! I ordered them for a friends going away party, it was cat themed. Everyone loves them, even the guys wore them... I didn’t really give them a choice lol. Some of the reviews said they fell apart, ours were great!
Output:positive
Input:It was exactly what it said
Output:positive
Input:Worked nothing like it said it would.

Ġhusband,Ġbag,"Input:I bought this for my husband for Father's Day and did not get to use it until July 4th to travel to Costa Rica and by the time we got down there and unpacked it smelled like rotten fish (like fish sauce) and we just can't stand it! Everything else about the bag is awesome, spacious, and feels and looks nice but we can't use it smelling like that!  So bummed!
Output:negative
Input:It's one of the few soaps my husband isn't allergic to. It doesn't make him fried out or oily:  nice balance.
Output:positive
Input:All The tops do not stay on. I bought for my husband for his birthday a week before and he opened it today. I’m guessing defective now I can’t take back. Horrible quality a waste of $30 don’t buy.
Output:negative
Input:The fine mist is perfect for restyling my curls between hair washing! I a second one for my curly haired daughter and need to buy a third one for my husband, because he keeps using mine! It is also a fantastic mister for my indoor succulents!
Output:positive
Input:I was following her on Instagram and that was the reason that I asked my husband to get this for my birthday! I was using this for a year and two months and all of a sudden a couple of days ago it stopped working for no reason!!!! Really! just a year! I paid $70 for an Iron (Braun) before and I used that for almost 5-6 years without a problem. The Iron itself doesn't have a high quality depending on the price and now you know it doesn't last long!
Output:negative
Input:I ordered the El Burrista to try for my husband. His goatee and mustache hair is of a medium course texture and graying a little bit. The beard oil has made his beard hair softer, less course and he has said the skin underneath isnt as dry. The beard wax allows him to shape his goatee into a neat, tidy look. He says its easy to incorporate into his morning routine. A free sample of the beard wash was included but unfortunately as much as I like the scent, he didnt favor the tea tree oil smell. I wish the beard wash came in El Burrista scent. Now on to the scent portion of review. The Burrista has a fantastic smell of fresh roasted coffee. It isnt a loud scent or overwhelming in any way. Its subtle but noticeable. As a woman I find the scent attractive lol. Its masculine but not like trying to hard and in your face strong. Its quite lovely. Its most certainly on our to buy often list. My husband doesnt usually have much to say beyond its ok when asked if he likes a product but he said this stuff is awesome. So its definitely good. We both also like that its made in the US, and free of chemicals or unpronounceable ingredients.
Output:positive
Input:My husband only uses this product now as others have caused mouth issues.  He is very fastidious about his cleaning and Dr. B Dental solution does exactly what it states!  Highly recommend if you need a cleaning solution!!!
Output:positive
Input:This particular beard brush didn't get hot enough to straighten my husband's beard. No matter how long we left it plugged in for or how slowly we went through his beard. It simply did not work for us. Return was really easy though!
Output:negative
Input:I ordered it for my husband and when it came in it was the size of a baby brush
Output:negative
Input:First of all, the wrong color was delivered. It came in white or a beige. The ad said the stool was extra wide. Not! The height adjustment extended only about a few inches up. I kept it because my husband had assembled it before I could tell him it came in the wrong color. But he uses it. I don’t like it!😝
Output:negative
Input:I got this for my husband since he loves the Mahogany teakwood smell. He used it a few times and it smells overwhelmingly like vanilla, so much so that I don't smell any of the wood. The soap worked great, kept his beard clean and soft, but the smell was just too much.
Output:negative
Input:This is amazing cream. I have used it for about a week now and I can already tell a difference and so can my husband. I am 5'6&#34;, 146 pounds and wear size 6-8 in clothing. I work out and for 49 I am told I look much more like 35. That said, I have always had an inclination to dimply bits around the upper thigh and bum - believe me, the older I get the harder to keep this under control. I feel new motivation in my work outs and diet because of this cream. I am seeing such noticeable improvement that I want to push myself harder than ever and see if I can take my 50's to a whole new level. I'm not saying I look like I had 5 lbs of liposuction on each thigh, but this is truly a distinct improvement. Highly recommend this and I WILL buy it again and again.<br /><br />One thing - it is an unusual texture with a tendency for some of the natural oils to come to the top, not unlike peanut butter. Also it is kind of a beige-tan color which surprised me. There is a scent because it has several natural herbs and oils. I like it, kind of woodsy, so does my husband but I can see how some people might not be keen on it. It does diminish once on the skin for about 10-15 minutes. If you like earthy, musk or wood scents then this will subtly blend with your perfume.<br /><br />Love it - so glad I found it, it sounds unreal but I feel like it gave me a new leash on life!
Output:positive
Input:I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it and can't stop talking about how quiet it is and close shave with very little effort. Head movement is perfect. Best buy of the season!
Output:positive
Input:This works very well. My husband, my son and I all use it. It keeps us all fresh for hours. Can't wait to get some more.
Output:positive
Input:I am gonna order like 2 more of these. am gonna start stocking up because when i first bought it, it became unvailble and i missed it. now that she is selling it again, i need to stock up. i love this lotion, just a couple of days i have used it and my skin feels so good. when i put on me and my son, we smell like chocolate and everyone loves it. i love how it makes my skin feel moisturized. now that i think about it, it was the same lotion i used right before i gave birth to my son and after he got delivered, my skin was glowing. my husband kept admiring me. i noticed it and now i am notiicing it again. i am in love with this lotion guys.

Ġclips,Ġcost,"Input:I actually bought this set of colors because I was planning on dressing my daughters up all the same for pictures but since the dresses I order on amazon we’re cheaply made now I have to send these colors back..but other then that they were ok looking more like dollar store type of hair clips
Output:negative
Input:The clips I was sent are not double hinged alligator clips, but plain ones. They are thin and flimsy. I admit I didn’t read the reviews this time and I regret it.
Output:negative
Input:Received item as described. Fits my headbands perfectly. I store hair ties and clips in the compartments
Output:positive
Input:very disappointed as it only shows a black clip and doesn't say ANYTHING about white. I received a half black and half white  batch when thinking I was only receiving black.  I will contact the shipper regarding this as I was under the impression I was receiving 12 black clips.
Output:negative
Input:Not the right clips, not the same color or material as the ones I received from them months ago. Description and photos are completely inaccurate.
Output:negative
Input:I dont even want to give it one star. Inside the package it smelt rancid. The clips were covered in a gross liquid. The packaging was completely fine, but the bags they came in were oozing and mold. I am disgusted.
Output:negative
Input:I have received the product however they are way too tiny. I need the adult size clips
Output:negative
Input:The only extensions I use. I bought the shade “dark blonde” and dyed them pink to match the rest of my hair. 1 pack of 18 inches, and 1 pack of 20 inches blended into my hair perfectly! The clips are nice and sturdy too which is always a plus.
Output:positive
Input:If you have thick hair you will need AT LEAST 3 sets for it to be passable. Sturdy clips, not painful to wear but again they are VERY thin.
Output:negative
Input:I was so disappointed to get a package of hair clips that were entirely broken and melted. The glue had melted leaving the clips without the resin. The clips were congealed into one glob. Very strange.
Output:negative
Input:Love them. Came just in time and I'm amazed it can hold my hair when I'm styling it. Usually clips break or my hair comes out of it because how straight my hair is but these clips are amazing! Definitely worth paying for
Output:positive
Input:So the clips does what it's intended to do in not leaving any creases but on the flip side, it snags and pulls the hair really bad. A bit of tweaking is needed in the design of these. Also, if you have normal to thick hair...one may not be enough to hold a pincurl if this is what you're using them for.
Output:negative
Input:One of the clips arrived broken! The clasp is very stiff and too hard to open! I would not recommend or ever buy again.
Output:negative
Input:These clips did not last a day without breaking!
Output:negative
Input:Some clips are already not working and two of the bottles are already broken 😰
Output:negative

Output:negative
Input:I did the regimen daily for 2 minutes as recommended for 30 days without missing a treatment. My wrinkles around my eyes are much worse now. Don’t buy this product.
Output:negative
Input:These feel great at first but over a few days they made my eyes burn and be much redder. Wish they would have worked but not for me.
Output:negative
Input:Patches of the metallic coating came off while I was putting them on...they were well sized , sturdy and well rounded which made for a secure fit that lasted 7 days before the first pop off
Output:negative
Input:I've been using this product for 5 days and I havent seen any change in my teeth non whatsoever!!! I've been using the toothpaste in the morning and brushing for 2 minutes and then in the evening o use the toothpaste and whitening powder as directed for 2 minutes each and nothing has changed at all!!! I'll use for maybe another week and I'm gonna get some different toothpaste!!! $58 dollars I spent on 2 bottles of whitening powder and 4 bottles of peppermint flavored toothpaste WASTE OF MONEY!

Input:I've been searching for a long time for a mascara that would actually be waterproof and not transfer to my undereye area - without success.  Until now.  I have to echo what everyone else is saying here: once applied, this stuff Does. Not. Budge.  It curls, it thickens, but y'all better be prepared to have this stuff on until the apocalypse, because I still haven't managed to really clean off the first layer I put on four days ago.  And there's not much time to second guess once applied because it dries within 2 seconds.  I took a shower within 5 minutes of first using this product (for testing purposes) and gave my face a good wash, and... I honestly couldn't believe it.  I almost cried with happiness.  Even if I had it wouldn't have mattered, because this mascara apparently requires an army of nanobots to clean off.  I'm in love. I've finally found The One.<br /><br />So, the pros:<br /><br />Yes, it lasts. Boy howdy does it last.<br /><br />It does not smudge.  It does not transfer.  It becomes bound to your soul as well as your lashes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />This mascara laughs in the face of typical eye makeup removers.  I still haven't figured out how to remove this stuff (not that I'm really complaining) but another reviewer suggested oil cleansing with a microfiber cloth, so I'll give that a shot once I get tired of looking fabulous.  (Seriously, it's almost like I'm wearing falsies.)<br /><br />This product, because it dries so quickly and is of such an unusual consistency, does not take kindly to additional coats.  (This is not a problem for me, as the first coat is more than impressive on its own.)<br /><br />Again, due to quick drying, if you've got any clumps you have to act fast to comb them out.  Just be careful with application (don't overload the brush) and this shouldn't be much of an issue.<br /><br />Important note: Normally when applying mascara, you want to get deep into the root of your lashes.  DON'T try that with this mascara.  You might get little flecks or fibers in your eye and it is not fun. If you must, use another mascara to get at the base, and use this unholy formula on the rest.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough.  But just be sure you know what you're getting into.  If you're big into having a totally makeup-free face before bed, be prepared to spend an extra few minutes each night forming a prayer circle and experimenting with ancient alchemy to get your lashes clean.

Input:I have a dog I'm slightly allergic to, and the changing of seasons are always bad too.  I used to wake up and reach for some excredrin for the constant headache, or just tough it out and wait six hours for the pressure that built up in my head overnight to dissipate.  Now I just make my way to the mirror (or on very bad days say ""honey will you please bring me my roller??) and just get to work.  You know how sometimes in a deep tissue massage you don't know if you're moaning in relief or because maybe it sorta hurts? I sound like that in the morning.<br /><br />But it's just been the best thing ever.  I follow the instructions for ""lymphatic drainage"", really focusing on where my sinuses are and rolling them out (with no small amount of pressure).  Within five minutes my headache is gone and I feel so much better.  Are there anti-aging benefits, am I firming my neckline and sculpting my face? I don't know. maybe. come back in ten years. I do it at night as well, though, so I obviously enjoy the process even when I don't need it for sinus relief.<br /><br />As far as the quality of this roller in particular?  I'm very impressed.  It arrived with no chips.  It is cool to the touch, although will match your skin temperature eventually.  It rolls easily, and is not ""squeaky"".  It is of a higher quality than some of the rollers sold at sephora.<br /><br />I have already bought my mother one for Christmas, since she has very puffy eyes and also gets sinus headaches, that is how much I love facial rolling and this roller in particular.
Output:positive
Input:I did not realize all the reviews giving this product one of the highest ratings for shampoos were all bought by this company. Unfortunately, the reviews giving this product 1 star were the truth. This shampoo smells awful, I also had a reaction to it as I saw others experienced, and it leaves a horrid feeling on my skin and hair. I'm not sensitive to products at all, no known allergies. However, I itched for days after using this shampoo and started developing a rash. Amazon really should remove this product and its fake reviews as I feel scammed.
Output:negative
Input:Does not work. It smells like skunk and then like vomit that almost made me throw up and smell stayed for three days even if I wash my hair every day..
Output:negative
Input:Horrible hair it was frizzing up within days
Output:negative
Input:I bought this shampoo & used it & seemed to me my hair was getting drier so looked at the ingredients & there it was “Sulfate “ in it, bad for highlighted & fine hair, so had to throw it out as the 30 days was up by a couple of days. I also had bought the Paul brown conditioner & it said in “big” letters sulfate & paraben free,
Output:negative
Input:I applied these nails using the glue tabs it came with, they did not last a day. I applied them at night, some came out while I was sleeping, the rest early in the morning. They do not adhere at all. I have used Impress Nails for a long time, and they lasted me for 10 days on average. Was hoping for this at least last for 3-4 days, yet very huge disappointment.
Output:negative
Input:It looks like it would work well considering the sleek design, but it doesn't. I tried it right out of the box and it wouldn't take my hair off despite numerous passes over the same area. I figured it wasn't charged enough. Nope. I charged it for full two days, and it still will take only a few little hairs off here and there. I seriously got a micro trimmer at the dollar store that works better. Two stars for the two hairs it cut.
Output:negative
Input:I've only used this for two days and I like it. I have been using under my arms where I tend to get hidradenitis suppurativa flare ups the most.  Normally, its hard to put any type of product on top of the sores and inflammation because that can easily aggravate the problem more.  However, after using this I've had no problems. It's actually been quite soothing. I know as soon as I run out, I will be ordering more.  Thanks Elderberry Queen.

I used to wake up and reach for some excredrin for the constant headache, or just tough it out and wait six hours for the pressure that built up in my head overnight to dissipate.  Now I just make my way to the mirror (or on very bad guess say ""honey will you please bring me my roller??) and just get to work.  You know how sometimes in a deep tissue massage you don't know if you're moaning in relief or because maybe it sorta hurts? I sound like that in the morning.<br /><br />But it's just been the best thing ever.  I follow the instructions for ""lymphatic drainage"", really focusing on where my sinuses are and rolling them out (with no small amount of pressure).  Within five minutes my headache is gone and I feel so much better.  Are there anti-aging benefits, am I firming my neckline and sculpting my face? I don't know. maybe. come back in ten years. I do it at night as well, though, so I obviously enjoy the process even when I don't need it for sinus relief.<br /><br />As far as the quality of this roller in particular?  I'm very impressed.  It arrived with no chips.  It is cool to the touch, although will match your skin temperature eventually.  It rolls easily, and is not ""squeaky"".  It is of a higher quality than some of the rollers sold at sephora.<br /><br />I have already bought my mother one for Christmas, since she has very puffy eyes and also gets sinus headaches, that is how much I love facial rolling and this roller in particular.

Input:I did not realize all the reviews giving this product one of the highest ratings for shampoos were all bought by this company. Unfortunately, the reviews giving this product 1 star were the truth. This shampoo smells awful, I also had a reaction to it as I saw others experienced, and it leaves a horrid feeling on my skin and hair. I'm not sensitive to products at all, no known allergies. However, I itched for nails after using this shampoo and started developing a rash. Amazon really should remove this product and its fake reviews as I feel scammed.
Output:negative
Input:Does not work. It smells like skunk and then like vomit that almost made me throw up and smell stayed for three look even if I wash my hair every day..
Output:negative
Input:Horrible hair it was frizzing up within extra
Output:negative
Input:I bought this shampoo & used it & seemed to me my hair was getting drier so looked at the ingredients & there it was “Sulfate “ in it, bad for highlighted & fine hair, so had to throw it out as the 30 horrible was up by a couple of tell. I also had bought the Paul brown conditioner & it said in “big” letters sulfate & paraben free,
Output:negative
Input:I applied these nails using the glue tabs it came with, they did not last a day. I applied them at night, some came out while I was sleeping, the rest early in the morning. They do not adhere at all. I have used Impress Nails for a long time, and they lasted me for 10 which on average. Was hoping for this at least last for 3-4 This, yet very huge disappointment.
Output:negative
Input:It looks like it would work well considering the sleek design, but it doesn't. I tried it right out of the box and it wouldn't take my hair off despite numerous passes over the same area. I figured it wasn't charged enough. Nope. I charged it for full two days, and it still will take only a few little hairs off here and there. I seriously got a micro trimmer at the dollar store that works better. Two stars for the two hairs it cut.
Output:negative
Input:I've only used this for two days and I like it. I have been using under my arms where I tend to get hidradenitis suppurativa flare ups the most.  Normally, its hard to put any type of product on top of the sores and inflammation because that can easily aggravate the problem more.  However, after using this I've had no problems. It's actually been quite soothing. I know as soon as I run out, I will be ordering more.  Thanks Elderberry Queen.

Ġsomething,Ġset,"Input:While I'm trying to like this product it is a bit difficult.<br /><br />This formula does moisturize however it leaves an oily coat on my skin that takes hours to absorb. This is not ideal for anyone wanting to apply makeup as you would have to wait a good amount of time after applying this product. I am am also trying to use this as a night time moisturizer but again it leaves an oily coat and has seemed to cause me to break out a bit more than normal.<br /><br />This is not something I would recommend to anyone who is acne prone or uncomfortable with having an oily residue on their face.
Output:negative
Input:I don't used to use skin-care products often. As a male, it's just not something I used to give much thought to. However, as I get older, I do suffer from dry skin in the winter months as the lower humidity in my house tends to cause my skin to flake and break out in spots.<br /><br />So I thought I would try this vegan oil for dry skin and I'm not entirely impressed.<br /><br />First thoughts are that the bottle is very nice. I love the green color of the oil. When the light hits it just right, it looks very pleasing. The bottle comes with a lid attached to a dropper for application, which makes it a little difficult to apply. You have to hold the dropper with one hand and apply it to the other and rub it in. My concern with this method is how difficult it will be to pull up more oil when the bottle gets low, but I guess that remains to be seen.<br /><br />The oil itself is very greasy feeling. It literally feels like a lower viscosity motor oil and also has a sandy/gritty texture to it when applied. The scent is very strange as well. To me, it smells 100% like rubber. It's not a bad smell, but it's also not a pleasant smell. It's just a smell. If you've ever smelled rubber, you know what I mean.<br /><br />As for its effectiveness? Again, not impressed.<br /><br />I've been using it for about a week now, and I haven't really noticed any huge effects from the lotion. My skin is still peeling and dry in most of the places where I have applied this, but I would say there is a slight improvement. However, I'm not sure it's worth the price. I have used other, much cheaper, lotions/oils that have provided better results.<br /><br />Overall, this is just average to me. I'm just not sure it's worth the price of admission.

Input:This product is fake.  I was excited to find this perfume on sale on Amazon because I know it's been discontinued. I got one for my self and my partner.  On the first use, this perfume smells and has the same long-lasting alluring smell as the original Agar Blend. However, after a month, the smell changed to something more industrial and very alcoholic. The bottle keeps leaking too.  Worse, the smell does not last even for 2 minutes even if you sprayed the entire bottle. I am utterly disappointed with this perfume.
Output:negative
Input:Showed up 3 months after ordering and smell HORRIFIC. Like they are covered in some kind of strong chemical or something. I washed one off with soap and tried to use it but was getting whiffs of the chemical smell all day so I threw them away.
Output:negative
Input:Im so sad ! The ink was okay and dried with no transfer but the cat eye stamp came broken; the packaging was intact so clearly factory errror. Also the tip is a little to thick I wanted something more subtle for an everyday look. I’m returned it ASAP.
Output:negative
Input:I heard a lot of good things about this brand but after trying it / seeing the ingredients list I wasn’t too happy. My favorite is the moisture essence with 100% plant based squalane. It doesn’t have anything else and that is the only product I don’t mind using on my skin. It doesn’t have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don’t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don’t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn’t feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free. Overall, I just did not like the two out of three items. I posted a list of the ingredients for anyone who needs to refer to it.
Output:negative
Input:If I could give zero stars, I would. I should have known something was up when the item sounded to good to be true. I know the item is for peel-off nail polish, but this didn’t even last 45 minutes before it essentially rubbed off. The colors were practically translucent and required several coats, which then took longer to dry (thought it was supposed to be quick dry-hmmm). I was highly disappointed and threw the entire kit out.
Output:negative
Input:I really like the smell of this fragrance.  In addition the packaging was very nice.  It is not a lot you can say about perfume, because either like it or you don't.  I am not sure if this is the one that I was supposed to get because it looks different than what I received.  Nonetheless, I think it smell great and worth the buy.  I did however, receive this product at a discount in exchange for my personal and honest opinion.  I will more than likely add this to my collection.  It was my first time trying out something other than my favorites.
Output:positive
Input:I have owned several other Norelco Razors in the past and this one just doesn't work as well.  It gives you a very uncomfortable shave, misses areas all together, and doesn't work nearly as good as their previous razors.  Also - you basically have to clean it every day which is an awkward process because you have to individually lift each razor head and wash it out.  Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight so I am now forced to spend money on something else.  Sadly - good riddance!
Output:negative

Input:I got the natural body wave in color 1b and 20 inch in length. Tape is good quality but hair is absolutely not as advertised. The tape-ins I received were styled to LOOK like a body wave texture, but once they were pre-washed they flattened out completely! Also there was tons of what I assume is black hair dye that washed off of them and gave off a strong smell as well. It took a good 3 washes before the water ran clear. I didn't get to use them because the texture turned out to be very straight and flat and does not match my wavy hair. But I did give them to my sister who has very straight hair and the tape has honestly held up pretty great for her so far with daily washes even. She has mentioned several times that the hair gets strangely clumpy when styling with heat tools. Not sure if that is something chemical wise or because there may be synthetic hair mixed in. Over all bad purchase. Not worth the savings at all.
Output:negative
Input:Heads up- make sure to look at the added photos & don't go from the models hand. I figured the other photos were just poor quality, & that's why the nails looked so cheap. Upon opening the package I realized the ""poor quality"" photos of the nails is exactly what I got. They are VERY BASIC & design is 100% something you can do with a paint marker.<br />-- I am giving this 2 stars, Only because they did slip in the actual look of their product... Even though listing it was accompanied with a look & style these would never pass for.
Output:negative
Input:Color was not right. And seemed more like a shoe polish or something vs stamp.....

Ġbroke,Ġfine,"Input:It was gift . The bag broke in couple of days
Output:negative
Input:This s&p set is just the right size for where I have to put it. I remember my mother having a similar set as a kid. We used it for many years before the, at that time, rubber gasket the kept moisture from clumping the salt and pepper finally wore out and the spring broke in the lid. It’s been a half century since I last saw them and I’m glad they’re available again.
Output:negative
Input:The wand broke after 2 weeks.
Output:negative
Input:There are a lot of bald spots and the edges broke off so bad after I bleached it. I can’t even use this . It was a waste of my money
Output:negative
Input:used it one time just fine.  I cleaned it good after the first use but it broke when I attempted to use it a second time.  Not Happy!
Output:negative
Input:Cute design but flowers broke off after 2 uses
Output:negative
Input:Honestly, this brush was really good until it broke. The seller never got in contact with me after I messaged them but I had the brush for about 2 and a half months then one day it just stopped working. I would recommend it if it hadn’t broken.
Output:negative
Input:One of the straps broke after second use. not super easy to use. pretty awkward. some people might like it not me I’d rather just have a brush with a handle
Output:negative
Input:I've had this bag a month now an today it broke zipper broke no point in shear case if it won't close waste of money
Output:negative
Input:The clips broke very easily. Not very durable.
Output:negative
Input:These things are crap. As soon as we got them, my daughter dropped one on the floor and it broke. The next day we put two in her hair and one broke by the end of the day.
Output:negative
Input:I know this was a 30 dollar toddler size drum set. With that in mind, the drums held together for all of 2 minutes of my kid playing with it. Then the snaps were bent or broke. After that they were used as bowls. The stool would hold a teddy bear reliably. A toddler not so much.
Output:negative
Input:I've been using Norelco electric razors for about 40 years and they have always been fine. This electric razor worked well for about two years, then the shaving head frame and the trimmer broke, so it has turned out to be a real disappointment.
Output:negative
Input:My local Walmart stopped selling the wipes I was using (Garnier) so I was excited to find this 3 pack of wipes for such a low price. I had heard that Simple was for sensitive skin people so I decided to give these wipes a try, even though I don't have sensitive skin and don't usually have breakouts. These unfortunately broke me out! I used them for a week straight thinking my skin would eventually get used to them (since I had only been using one particularity brand of wipe for so long) BUT NO! These are a hard pass for me and make me weary about trying other Simple products.

Ġfast,Ġwish,"Input:Very long lasting, love the brush, love the design like a princess sparkle tower, feels lovely on, dries under my lamp very fast & holds all my bling in place, for all of these reasons this is probably the single best top coat I've ever owned.  Will definitely buy again hopefully Max Estada keeps making this!

Input:This is the first epilator I’ve tried, it broke within a month, I then decided to invest in something better. Ended up splurging for the Braun silk 9 flex— it’s twice as fast and much more thorough in getting the job done. This is definitely a tool worth paying for decent quality.
Output:negative
Input:This product cleaned my makeup brushes very well. Very fast shipping! I loved the free scrub pad that came with the cleanser.

Input:This is the best quality hair that i have ever ordered<br />This hair is very good,guys.I purchased the hair 12, 12,12  inches,the length is accurate,and very soft,thick,no tangle ,no shed,very beautiful. The end is full,3 bundles and a closure and the color is perfect.I got the hair in 3 days,it was very fast delivery.I am very grateful to the company, they always send me good quality hair,because it is the same as what they described.About hair,i have no complaints.They also give me a free pair of eyelashes ,i will definitely buy more hair from MyDiva trust this company.

Input:Wow, I can’t love these enough!! 3 curly bun wraps to add so much volume to my bun!! I got compliments on my hair all day by so many people!! The dark blonde matched my hair perfectly. I’m sleepy surprised by the quality. These are thick and lays pretty! No hair fell out and it only took me 5mins to pull my hair up, make a fast bun, use this curly bun wrap, and pull out some of my front curls! Fast, easy, and professional polished look in an instant. HUGE FAN!! Love these!!!

Input:I have tried many natural deodorants. Usually I either break out, or end up smelling...... funky. I did have visible redness but no sensitivity for the first couple of days. This stuff really works and keeps the stink away!! The only downside is I feel like I am going through the deodorant really fast! Just wish it lasted longer
Output:positive
Input:This hairdryer is small, easy to take when traveling. The wind of the hairdryer is also very strong, and the drying speed is very fast. It can also adjust the cold air and hot air. It's pink, and I like the color very much！

Input:Very comfortable, suction cups work great, dried pretty fast.
Output:positive
Input:I used to have a really expensive portable clipper that I used all the time when I have to travel. When that broke, I decided to buy a less expensive one.  There wasn't any difference really. This one cuts really close and charges really fast. Put some oil on the blades to keep it nice and sharp. The accessories are a + because if you buy a regular one from the store, it comes with just the clipper itself.<br />Edit: Knew it was too good to be true. Trimmer won't charge up anymore. Will be returning.
Output:negative
Input:This item came in the factory box and was well protected enroute.  I shop-<br />ed around for this item and found it to be even cheaper on this site than<br />Wal-Mart.  This item works extremly well; my dentist uses one and also<br />thinks it is great.  The shipping was efficient and fast.

Ġmascara,ĠT,"Input:This mascara is awesome, goes on easily and stays on, even overnight.  The only thing that is weird about it, when you go to remove it, it comes off in pieces, not like all smeary, which I personally like.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is it comes off clean.
Output:positive
Input:Great product! I am a professional makeup artist. I have used many famous brand mascara. This mascara is very good for me to use. So I recommend it.
Output:positive
Input:I got this for my 6 yr old girl, who has handful of baby hair along her hairline on her forehead. I have previoulsy purchased similar product from a different company which was very efficient!!  But i stumbled upon this particular product and they were giving away 2 instead of 1, so decided to give this brand a try. Bad Mistake. Both bottles were literally filled with “nothing”...it is suppose to be filled with clear hair gel like substance. There was hardly any product inside the bottle. It was so upsetting. I would warn you NOT to purchase this product unless you are into collecting empty mascara bottles... i just threw them out... i didnt even want to bother with this absurd situation over $7.
Output:negative
Input:Love the mascara! Lengthens beautifully but doesn’t clump and easy to remove.
Output:positive
Input:Great mascara.  Separates and coats each lash. Love it.
Output:positive
Input:I previously ordered the black tube and loved it. This came dried out and the top broke off the lash brush the first time I used it. It barely looked like I was wearing mascara. I returned and ordered the black.
Output:negative
Input:Hardly even will remove my concealer. Definitely doesn't remove my eyeliner or mascara at all. I hate that I wasted my money on 6 packages of these.
Output:negative
Input:Great mascara, doesn't tend to run unless you are extremely sweaty or are doing water activities
Output:positive
Input:I've never used fiber mascara so I didn't know what to expect. This went on easily (mascara first then fibers) and it made a noticeable difference! It wasn't too clumpy/spidery but definitely added length and volume.<br />I rubbed my eye and didn't end up with black smears across my face, but it did shed the fibers so there was a collection of fine black fibers underneath my eyes. They would have to be wiped up and check on occasionally.<br />I gave this 4 stars because it didn't seem to last very long and would have to frequently be reapplied. I will have to test again and see how long it lasts when I don't accidentally rub my eye.
Output:positive
Input:One of the tubes of mascara was empty, the other caused eye irritation. Bought this on Amazon because sephora was sold out but wouldn't do it again.
Output:negative
Input:I love this mascara it gives me length and volume.
Output:positive
Input:DEFINITELY disappointed in this product.  My mascara seemed very dry and not at all as advertised.  :(
Output:negative
Input:I have been wearing individual eyelash extension for 7 years and I lost and damaged a lot of my own lashes. I bought this mascara because of the value at first. When I received it and tried it on, I was very impressed with it. It lengthens my real lashes. It’s not clumpy either.
Output:positive
Input:I received the eyelash shampoo in a box that was slightly damaged but the product itself was undamaged. All items pieces were accounted for. The instructions and warnings were easy to read and follow. The shampoo foams nicely and I didn't experience any irritation. I only used the mascara looking wand, which is sufficient for my needs. This shampoo has multiple uses other than cleaning eyelash extensions, it also cleans up mascara really nicely as well. very simple to use and no offensive smells. Overall I'm satisfied with the eyelash shampoo, it does what it's stated to do and more! The price is pretty average and comparable to other eyelash shampoos out there though. But I may stick to this one since I know it works, doesn't have a strong smell, and doesn't irritate my eyes. 5 stars.
Output:positive
Input:Wow! Great value for the price! I paid $25 for just the mascara at Ulta a month ago.

ĠShe,ĠGreat,"Input:I have only let my teen use deoderants due to health concerns.  I like the ingredients on this product and felt confident in ordering it for her.

That is high praise from her.<br /><br />Several weeks after starting to use it, I've heard 0 complaints.  From a kid who complains about everything, this is excellent indeed!

Input:My granddaughter loved this!  Had a friend with miniature ponies on her property and she invited the kids to see them. They were so docile and the kids could sit on them!  We had an idea to bring this 'mane' and tail with us to clip on a chosen 'white' pony's actual mane and tail for a picture of her sitting on top of this cute little 'turned magic' pony. Gave it a surreal look!  She plays with this at home too, clips the tail to the waist of her pants in the back and wears the 'mane' wig!  Such a cute age for kids.

Unfortunately I have to keep the defective items because I didn't want to break my little one's heart and tell her we needed to send them back. They will be broken within days because of the location of the cracks. DISAPPOINTED.

Gave it a surreal look!  top plays with this at home too, clips the tail to the waist of her pants in the back and wears the'mane' wig!  Such a cute age for kids.

Ġwork,Ġkeeps,"Input:Came in a 3 pack as shown in black, navy and white. Pretty sturdy, only had a little unraveling with my black one since I wear it so often. All I did was put a little hot glue and good as new. I work in healthcare and since this whole pandemic started, I've been wearing my hair tied up and use this headband to keep hair away from my face while wearing my mask all day. Would buy again!
Output:positive
Input:My package arrived all busted up and taped up like it was returned and resent to me<br />The growth serum did not work for me at all. The roller I felt didn’t picture the skin enough.<br /> None of the products had any pleasant scents.<br />The beard wash was good, really cleaned the beard And left it feeling clean and fresh.<br />I recommend the beard wash but not the rest of the products.

Input:Tried numerous shower mirrors over the years and this is the only one that doesn’t fog or fall off the wall. Suction cups all eventually fail ( nothing like a mirror falling at 3:00 AM to get the hart pumping).  The stick-on hooks work but the mirror flops around like a lure for Walleyes. This is it, works on both tile and fiberglass as long as it’s flat.
Output:positive
Input:I really wanted this stuff to work!  Unfortunately, all it did was make me feel wetter, which I didn't have a problem with in the first place.  So, in fact, it actually felt looser rather than tighter because, due to the wetness, we lost what little friction we had without the product.<br />  The first time I tried this, I applied it about 10 minutes prior to intercourse.  The second time, I made sure I was really dry inside first (just wiped with toilet paper), and then applied, waited 10 minutes, applied again, and waited another 10 minutes, then approached hubby.  I thought maybe increased amount over longer period of time would help give the product time to work.  But, yet again, it did nothing for me.<br />  I've had 4 vaginal deliveries of babies about 7.5 lbs, so maybe that plays a role.  I am very sad because I had high hopes for what this product might be able to do.  I guess some sort of surgery (that I can't afford) is my only hope of my husband and I having a good sex life again.
Output:negative
Input:I wonder why it has so many good reviews here. It doesn't work at all.
Output:negative
Input:The mirror on one side arrived loose, I glued it back down and it seems to be holding fine. When it is closed, it wiggles a little. Definitely not the best quality, but it's a cute little mirror to keep in my work bag.
Output:positive
Input:Described as 'ideal for travel' with it's multi-voltage design, but it is totally useless for this purpose. The electrical plug is a standard US one with a polarized large neutral pin that will happily plug into a US wall socket, but won't plug into any country adapter I've found. We tried 4 different types of adapter for Australia/NZ and UK and none of then would work even though 2 had the facility for the correct polarized pin design. Also, as others have pointed out the lever for the opening mechanism is cheap plastic that flexes badly against the power of a spring. This looks like it will last maybe a couple of uses before snapping off - if you can find somewhere to plug it in!
Output:negative
Input:Doesn't work that great with age and im only 50
Output:negative
Input:I have sensitive skin. I have read that to exfoliate skin gently acids would be better, but I think that sounds scary and I will stick with my facial scrubs, that work well for me, if they are designed for sensitive skin. This on has been gentle and I still get results. Smooth skin.
Output:positive
Input:Using this in the shower after the shooting range and I just feel better about my lead management. I start top to bottom with the lukewarm water, but not hot. No cold showers for me even if thats ideal for lead removal. Works well on my hair, face (it will hurt if you get it in your eyes so be careful and keep your eyes extra shut tight) and body. It has a good consistency and is about the right amount of soap suds/lather to feel like you are washing without using an excessive amount of body wash. It does leave a bit of soap smell after rinsing, so after using this I wash with regular shampoo/conditioner and my regular bath soap (the second wash is with nice hot water). On this second wash I also use baby shampoo on my face and eyelids just to get any residual off. Overall no issues and I'm glad that I'm using a product designed to get the lead off. My range clothing goes right into the washer with the d-lead laundry detergent. Its just good to know I'm no longer spreading lead in my house. I had no idea until I researched it. Overall good product and if you work with lead, you should minimize the amount you bring back into your house.

Output:positive
Input:Picture doesn't do the actual pins justice. They are very pretty although a little heavy. May not work well for those with thin hair. One of the pins did have a diamond missing, but it was in the box and can be easily glued back on. I plan to give these to my bridesmaids to use in their hair for my wedding.
Output:positive
Input:I have been using Gelish gel polish at home for 2-3 years now, using a UV light with perfect results for the standard 1-2 minute dry times. I then bought this product to speed up drying time, but it didn't work at all. After 30 seconds, my coat was still completely wet. Even after a full 2 minutes, the polish rubbed off with the next coat. I have since returned this lamp and would not recommend that others buy it for gel nail curing.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Came in a 3 pack as shown in black, navy and white. Pretty sturdy, only had a little unraveling with my black one since I wear it so often. All I did was put a little hot glue and good as new. I as in healthcare and since this whole pandemic started, I've been wearing my hair tied up and use this headband to keep hair away from my face while wearing my mask all day. Would buy again!
Output:positive
Input:My package arrived all busted up and taped up like it was returned and resent to me<br />The growth serum did not try for me at all. The roller I felt didn’t picture the skin enough.<br /> None of the products had any pleasant scents.<br />The beard wash was good, really cleaned the beard And left it feeling clean and fresh.<br />I recommend the beard wash but not the rest of the products.

Input:Tried numerous shower mirrors over the years and this is the only one that doesn’t fog or fall off the wall. Suction cups all eventually fail ( nothing like a mirror falling at 3:00 AM to get the hart pumping).  The stick-on hooks wearing but the mirror flops around like a lure for Walleyes. This is it, works on both tile and fiberglass as long as it’s flat.

Input:I hate visiting the dentist, just like everyone else. However, back in 1994-1995 my friend (who's a dental assistant no less) recommend the new Braun/OralB Plaque Remover.<br />Needless to say, I have been using it every day since. Actually, the first one died after 5 years (what do you expect for a Ni-Cad battery) and my replacement unit just died this past month. So I am on my quest to purchase my third unit. And that's not a bad thing. I think 4 years use out of each one is pretty decent.<br />All of the other positive reviews here on Amazon are correct. The Braun Oral-B Plaque Remover does get your teeth really clean. It gets into places where you just can brush very well manually.<br />If you don't have one, get one -- that is, if your teeth are important to you.<br />Update 4/6/04: Almost 2 years have passed since I wrote the review above. The products are still working great, however, the brushes seem to be losing power as time goes on. I've followed the discharging instructions included with the product, but it still has not helped. Therefore, my rating has gone from 5 stars, to 4.<br />I wrote to Oral-B several times about this, but never received a reply. My previous Oral-B brushes had the same problem, but I attributed it to the fact that they had Ni-Cad batteries whereas the new ones have Nickel-Hydride.

Input:The only thing important on this product is the active ingredient chlorexidine. The standard concentration is 2%. Hibiclens is an &#34;overkill&#34; at 4%. Regardless, here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES on this chemical agent.<br />.<br />.<br />ADVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser - the &#34;gold standard&#34; in the opinion of numerous medical people. According to all available literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens and disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane wall, thus destroying the organism. Because human and animal tissues are also negatively charge, the agent binds to the skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth.<br />. . . The antiseptic properties only affect organisms on the skin. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY's &#34;Penetration of Chlorhexidine into Human Skin&#34; reported &#34;poor penetration of chlorhexidine into skin following 2 min. and 30 min. exposures to chlorhexidine was observed.&#34; In other words, the agent is relatively safe because it does not penetrate the skin and get absorbed into human tissue or the blood stream and cause damage or toxic chemical reactions.<br />.<br />2. Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%.<br />.<br />In most hospitals, physicians scrub their hands with this agent before surgery. Also, patients must wash with this agent on the evening and morning before their operations.<br />.<br />3. A 2% solution is the recommended concentration to be used for surgical scrubbing according to EPIC and CDC guidelines. This maybe an overkill for consumer usage. As a skin cleanser, THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS NURSING reported that anything over a 0.5% concentration showed &#34;no significant differences statistically, including persistent effects within 24 hours.&#34; A lower strength of 0.2% was just as effective according to INT. ENDED J. 2001. The only difference is speed. A 0.2% concentration takes 1 min. to completely kill E. Faccalis while a 2% concentration takes 30 sec.<br />. . . The ineffective limit is a 0.12% concentration. This does not kill E. Faccalis. The above findings were replicated and confirmed by a more recent U.S. study in J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb.<br />. . . For oral rinsing, it is a different matter because the mouth is not covered by skin but mucus membrane. It is also host to different germs. The standard treatment is a 0.12% chlorhexidine concentration. However, optimum effects require a higher concentration. Clinical trials reported by THE JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY said that a 1% concentration &#34;showed a significant reduction through intensive treatment (3-4 daily applications over 2 days) or through daily application for 10 and 14 days.&#34;<br />.<br />4. Because a 0.2% concentration is just as effective as &#34;straight out of the bottle,&#34; a 2% chlorhexidine can be diluted with water to yield ten times the amount of usable disinfectant. Also, a 4% Hibiclens concentration can yield 20 times the amount.<br />.<br />5. Hibiclens is overpriced. The cheapest on amazon.com is $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive. . . . It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of the stuff.<br />.<br />A cheaper alternative is to buy a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate from a pet products vendor. The cheapest is sold by Greener Pastures Veterinary Service Store for $8.25/gallon. If the user purchases $100+, there is free 2-day shipping.<br />.<br />6. Among most chlorhexidine literature from manufacturers, they recommend one to two ounces to a gallon of cleaning solution for sanitizing floors, counter-tops, and furniture. In addition, anecdotal testimonies from pet owners, stores, and clinics report a reduction in sicknesses among animals when the solution is used to clean their cages, skin, and gums.<br />. . . This is surprising. One ounce of chlorhexidine to a gallon of water amounts to a 0.03125% solution. According to a study by the J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb., E. Faccalis bacteria was smeared on glass cones. A 0.12% chlorhexidine concentrate failed to kill the strain. It required a 0.2% or higher to do the job.<br />. . . Based on these facts, the only possible conclusion is that the weaker concentration does not directly kill existing bacteria but creates a hostile environment for germ growth. The chemical inhibits the spread of dangerous organisms on the skin, mouth, and inorganic surfaces. Through time, the noxious population is further reduced. Thus, it becomes less dangerous to the host.<br />.<br />7. J. ACQUIR. IMMUNE. DEFIC. SYNDR. 2004 Feb. 1 reported that a 0.25% concentration is well tolerated by women, even in the sensitive vaginal area. At 1% concentration, there were 13% complaints of burning and itching.<br />.<br />.<br />DISAVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The product has risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes ulceration damages.<br />.<br />2. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction: irritation and redness. Washing the affected area with soap and water will negate the problems within 72 hours.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.<br />.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS<br />.<br />Based on two medical studies, a water dilution of chlorhexidine to a 0.2% concentration is the minimum for eliminating microbial organisms. Leave it on for a 1 minute. As an added bonus, the 0.2% concentration is well tolerated, even in the vaginal area of females. . . . If you want a quick guaranteed kill, use a 0.5% concentration.<br />.<br />For inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria on counter-tops, floors, pet cages, and animals, one-to-two ounces of 2% chlorhexidine to a gallon of water &#34;will do the job.&#34; Again, this only reduces the germ population by restrict

Input:Copper peptide serums usually cost around $100 - $400. This is a high GHK-Cu content serum that's highly absorbent, non-pilling and extremely lightweight so that it's great for layering serums. The reason why it's nice to have a lightweight, fast-absorbing copper peptide serum is that I also use it on cuts and other superficial wounds because GHK-Cu is a well-established aid to skin healing for surgical scars & other medical applications. I also use this after microneedling, as it's used by dermatologists as part of the serums applied during microneedling treatments as copper peptides are a factor in collagen and elastin growth. GHK-Cu is also 20-60% more effective at promoting collagen building than Vitamin C or retinoic acid, so I use it as an alternative to retinols when my skin gets too dehydrated & leathery from retinoids. This is the second bottle of this product I've used and it's ideal for all the reasons I keep a copper peptide serum on hand.<br /><br />I also love that there is so much goodness in such a light, fast-absorbing formula. The concentration of copper cannot be really high, and the other ingredients that are also top collagen-promoting skin conditioners I look for: Aloe Extract, Licorice, seaweed ferment, bifida ferment, hyaluronic acid, beta glucans & centella. The only ingredient I'm unfamiliar wth is radish root, which I believe is a natural antibacterial perservative. There are no ingredients of a synthetic or chemical nature, which explains why it's so light and non-pilling unlike so many other serums one tries to layer.

Input:I have only one regret with this purchase; That I didn't make it sooner! I tortured myself for years with an antique or perhaps antiquated Emjoi epilator. Ouch!  When it finally gave out, I did my research and bought this one. Let me tell you- this is NOT your mother's epilator! This is fantastic! It's much faster, gets the tiniest of hairs and the pain is much, much less! This model has a light to help get every hair and can even be used in the shower if you so choose. It's top quality and looks good too! If you have never used an epilator, there will be some pain the first few times, (let's be honest beauty isn't pain free) but it diminishes with each use and it's so worth it!  Hair removal every 4-6 weeks vs every day? That's a &#34;no brainer&#34;! It's less painful than waxing, definitely less messy and easy to do yourself, in the comfort of your own home! It doesn't get better than that!<br />I am so happy with it! It works like a dream. My only regret is not buying it sooner!<br />100% Satisfied and hair free. LOL

Input:[[VIDEOID:739c27eee1f2f5200361bb38c669932a]] You don't get a lot of product, but it's a cheaper set of polish, so I guess you get what you pay for. The results are nice. I've used two of the colors so far and the quality is nice. I used a plain black base coat (just one coat, after a gel base, of course... and two coats of the actual cat eye color, topped off with clear top coat). I looked up different techniques on how to use cat eye nail polish on YouTube and got some good tips. Overall, I'd buy this again.

Input:Bought these because I liked the design of the product over the full upper....and expensive.... dental guard my dentist made for me last time. The one made by my dentist restricted my breathing and caused my mouth to become so dry that I would wake up in the middle of the night. While these DenTek guards were comfortable, stayed in place and didn't restrict my breathing, the two pads that separate your top and bottom teeth on both sides was so hard that I actually woke up with a headache two days in a row. If you clench your teeth at night like I do, these two small bite pads actually increase the pressure on fewer teeth instead of spreading it out over all your teeth and actually increased the pain of teeth from clenching. I discovered Plackers Grind no More Night Guards which have the same design as the DenTek Platinum guards but made out of a softer material that solved this problem. The Plackers are considered disposable, but have been lasting me about a week each and at $16 for a 14 count pack /$1.20 per guard its worth it. They are the most comfortable dental guards I have used, stay in place with no issue and work great.

Input:[[VIDEOID:739c27eee1f2f5200361bb38c669932a]] You don't get a lot of product, but it's a cheaper set of polish, so I guess you get what you pay for. The results are nice. I've used two of the colors so far and the quality is nice. I used a plain black base coat (just In coat, after a gel base, of course... and two coats of the actual cat eye color, topped off with clear top coat). I looked up different techniques on how to use cat eye nail polish on YouTube and got some good tips. Overall, I'd buy this again.
Output:positive
Input:I am with the MANY others who miss the maybelline charcoal grey eyebrow pencil, but this is one of the better substitutions I have found.  Good consistency and good color, not too black etc.  I have thinning eyebrows with dark hair, and black pencils are too heavy and the brown pencils are too red.  This is worth trying, I am glad I did!
Output:positive
Input:Expected the pump to work better. Difficult to use. Cream not smooth And have not noted any improvement in skin After one month of use.
Output:negative
Input:Bought these because I liked the design of the product over the full upper....and expensive.... dental guard my dentist made for me last time. The one made by my dentist restricted my breathing and caused my mouth to become so dry that I would wake up in the middle of the night. While these DenTek guards were comfortable, stayed in place and didn't restrict my breathing, the two pads that separate your top and bottom teeth on both sides was so hard that I actually woke up with a headache two days in a row. If you clench your teeth at night like I do, these two small bite pads actually increase the pressure on fewer teeth instead of spreading it out over all your teeth and actually increased the pain of teeth from clenching. I discovered Plackers Grind no More Night Guards which have the same design as the DenTek Platinum guards but made out of a softer material that solved this problem. The Plackers are considered disposable, but have been lasting me about a week each and at $16 for a 14 count pack /$1.20 per guard its worth it. They are the most comfortable dental guards I have used, stay in place with no issue and work great.
Output:negative
Input:Idk what product the other reviewers were reviewing but it’s not the same one I received. The stamp was huge! Made a crazy huge wing. I’d never walk out of the house like this. It looks ridiculous. Don’t buy this product. Such a disappointment.
Output:negative
Input:I have a larger bottle I like but wanted a smaller one for travel. This one is perfect.
Output:positive
Input:I only got one

ĠAlso,Ġwear,"Input:I opened immediately when I received the package, and I’m in love with it! Julia works perfectly well, it releases a good amount of steam and I’m amazed with the way Julia can move around the steam to easily access other areas of the room. The only thing is that the material is not as I expected, it seems to be plastic but at least it’s very light! Overall, this is a great diffuser.<br /><br />UPDATE: On the second day using it, I’ve realised it DOES NOT work for up to 18hours continuously, if even 6 hours. The diffuser doesn’t diffuse the whole water content inside it and always stops a bit before it’s over. Also, the function that lets it release steam moving in the room is not working anymore, as it stops in a particular side and seems to have trouble moving to the other side. I expected more from such an expensive diffuser

Input:Looks nothing like the picture. The Bangs are scarely there and they look terrible. There's no way for me to even cut additional bangs on it. Also the hair state to tangle almost immediately after I put it on. I would not recommend nor buy this unit again.
Output:negative
Input:Love the colors. Tried on my nails for the first time. Acrylic, glitter, acrylic in that order lol. Also none of my jars were damaged
Output:positive
Input:I have seen these used on You Tube alot lately. Never had tried one before. The ""bristles"" are soft and it does not feel like it's pulling my hair out. That is one thing I was worried about. I use when I shampoo once a week. Only shampoo that often due to wavy curly hair and dries out easily. Also have used it to detangle when I use conditioner on all the other days that I don't shampoo and co wash instead. Easy to use and fits nicely in my hand.
Output:positive
Input:I was confused upon opening the packaging that this liner was a felt tip rather than the usual brush tip. Also, the liner smudges and drags when you go over the same spot to fill in its patchy application. The liquid liner is not completely opaque and is really shiny when on. It creases and rubs off super easily even though the packaging says it's waterproof - it definitely isn't!
Output:negative
Input:These are cheaply made. The snap to close the cap was very hard to open & after only a few days the cap broke & would not close anymore. Also the hook isn't sturdy. The clamp would flop back and forth & wouldn't secure properly.
Output:negative
Input:This shampoo and conditioner made my hair very greasy unfortunately so I'm not a big fan. Also, it leaves a terrible residue. It does smell good though
Output:negative
Input:This is perfect if you are in the headline tones. Not to dark and not to light. Also it is organic!
Output:positive
Input:Was very unhappy with this product. The hair sheds in balls . Also don’t hold a style .
Output:negative
Input:Buyer beware: i dropped this water according to the temp and about 20-30 braids bunched up so BAD & BEYOND REPAIR! I was livid. When you spend hours on braiding someone’s hair and it bunches up with hot water, the last thing you want to do is to remove it and braid all 28 inches over again! I’ve never seen that happen before. Also, the hair does tangle but it is soft. Biggest problem is the bunching with hot water! If the water was too hot, it would have burned. I don’t believe you can hot water dip because it just ends up looking the same as the non dipped hair. I’m pissed!
Output:negative
Input:Hair feels great, but the length is way off. The bundles are extremely short. I ordered 10/12/14 but received 8/10. I guess I'll cut it into a Bob. Also when shampooed,  it turned the water red. I washed it a few more times before the water was clear.
Output:negative
Input:When I received this I read the instructions, charged the product and it has only worked once! When I tried to use it the second time, it would not come on at all. So I thought I would charge it again even though you are supposed to be able to use it more than once per charge. It still didn’t work. It is worthless. Also, the one time it did work, it actually is quite awkward to hold while washing your face.
Output:negative
Input:Great product. Looks even better in than the photo. Also is very durable. Great item.
Output:positive
Input:Considering I only got one of the 5 items I ordered. I'm not thrilled. Also, not thrilled that in order to get my money back or a new one I have to drive somewhere to make a return to them for this one tiny item. I just want my other 4 things.....
Output:negative
Input:Exactly what I was needing for grad thank you gifts. Also used for thank you cards.
Output:positive
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I opened immediately when I received the package, and I’m in love with it! Julia works perfectly well, it releases a good amount of steam and I’m amazed with the way Julia can move around the steam to easily access other areas of the room. The only thing is that the material is not as I expected, it seems to be plastic but at least it’s very light! Overall, this is a great diffuser.<br /><br />UPDATE: On the second day using it, I’ve realised it DOES NOT work for up to 18hours continuously, if even 6 hours. The diffuser doesn’t diffuse the whole water content inside it and always stops a bit before it’s over. anyone, the function that lets it release steam moving in the room is not working anymore, as it stops in a particular side and seems to have trouble moving to the other side. I expected more from such an expensive diffuser

Output:positive
Input:This stuff leaks on all your dog supplies.  You tighten lid so hard you can hardly get open and it still leaks.  I put mine in freezer bag.  It leaked all in bag.  Packaging stinks.
Output:negative
Input:I have thick wavy hair, and getting it under control can be a chore some days. Haven't used hair spray in years because most are just terrible and leave your hair crunchy with a weird unnatural shine. This stuff is great though. Sprays on without making a mess, has a good hold, but doesn't leave your hair looking like you just stepped out of the 1980's. Will definitely continue to use it.
Output:positive
Input:This stuff is great. Smells like melons and works awesome for my 2 year olds mini mohawk. By the end of the day it is mostly gone and doesn't leave the hair feeling gross at all! Almost like there was nothing there.
Output:positive
Input:Love this mitt!!! First off, it's black... So when you use the tanner you don't see the left over tanning stuff on it which is nice. It's SUPER soft and stays on your hand unlike other mitts I've used in the past.  I would highly recommend getting this mitt especially because of the disability and the price you can't beat for the quality!!
Output:positive
Input:This stuff is so glittery, in a good way. I was a little shocked, because I thought it would be more creamy, but it is kind of like a hard block of smooth glitter if that makes sense. Actually, when I first opened it up, when I tried to remove the little plastic cover the product actually lifted out of the container because it was dried onto the bottom of the cover. I was worried it would be a dud, but I coaxed the product back into the container, and it's been fine since. I just need to tap my fingertip lightly and I get enough glitter for one lid per dip. It just makes my eye look pop that little bit more.
Output:positive
Input:I love this product. I first got it when I went to a Cruise last month and from then on I use it twice a week. I know I need to order this mask for maintenance and I was thrilled that Amazon carry this product. I love how it has a second sheer/sponge-like layer which probably contains all the good stuffs that absorbs by your skin. I usually use it a little more than 10 mins, because I like how it drys up on my face. It feels like my skin drinks all of those good stuff from this mask. It leaves my skin feeling moisturised and healthy.
Output:positive
Input:It doesn't tell you that you need more stuff in order for it to work.
Output:negative
Input:It’s cheap, it has a lot of hair, it’s strong, if you already have dark hair you can do more stuff with it. At the back it doesn’t look bad, but it doesn’t feel like the front, at least the end with the small hairs, but it really doesn’t matter, lol. The quality is amazing for the price.
Output:positive
Input:This stuff really works for my facial sweating. I sprayed a small amount on a cotton ball at night - and it has really made a difference. So glad I found it!
Output:positive
Input:I loved the previous version of this - it was all I used. I found it better than even the prestige brands I’d tried. It stayed put beautifully and the tip was perfect size and firmness. This new version is awful. The tip is rock solid, making it so hard to get the thickness of line I want. You either use the very tip and get a barely noticeable line, or you get a huge fat line. The worst part is that this stuff comes off every time. I’m guaranteed raccoon eyes when I use it - it slides right off. So bummed because now I need to find something new. Don’t fix what isn’t broken, Physicians Formula.
Output:negative
Input:I've worn a bun maker every day to work for years and really depend on them to keep my hair out of my face. This one is made of a malleable wire-like frame on the inside with a black foam outside -- you have to mold the wire inner frame to adopt the shape you want. I found that after a few uses the wire frame became super warped and bumpy -- I had to keep molding it straight again before each use, and when I tried to re-curl it into a donut bun it wouldn't do so evenly -- all jagged and stuff instead of a nice round circle. After a while it became so lumpy bumpy it was impossible to mold it into a donut bun at all so I had to throw it away. Of all the donut bun makers I've tried, I still find the slap bracelet-style original Hairagami (don't get a knock-off!) the easiest the best by far.
Output:negative
Input:It arrived yesterday. It turns on and spins around whichevr little widget you have inserted. I tried it on smoothing down the rough skin on my bunions and the back edge of my heels. Reason I got it was to be able to remove my own powdered acrylic nail treatment, because the salon I go to charges extra for that. If I go in with already bare nails, I can save six bucks. Not time yet to try that, so will have to wait and see.<br /><br />As far as all the stuff that comes with the drill, there are three separate containers under the blister insert with the extra bits, and they are all hard to open -- I take that back: the two little plastic boxes are hard to open (I thought I would have to take pliers or a hammer to one of them), and the pink thing containing the &#34;surprise&#34; gift is a cute container with so much stuff in it that it cannot possibly close properly - so I took everything out of it and carry it in my purse when I figure out what I want to put in it.<br /><br />I kept going back and forth between 3 stars and 4 while writing this review but settled on 4 just because the drill is pink and does not look like a piece of hardware.

Input:I love this brush !  I used this specifically to clean my black convertible top on my car .  Wow,  what a difference  !  I used this brush with Ragg Top cleaner.  It got out the green mold spots that were showing and just film that has been building over the years on the top, sap from trees and pollen. I don't  have a garage so the car sits out in our driveway.  The top  just had  that dull look.  After using this brush , it got out all the green mold spots. got off all the imbedded pollen and any other film that accumulated over the years.  The brush is soft,  but strong enough to get this  stuff out !  I love that it did the job,  without damage my convertible top !  The convertible top is so much blacker and looks brand new.  This is a fantastic brush !  I highly recommend is product !  I would absolutely  buy  another one !

Ġsays,Ġalso,"Input:Does not do what it says.  Just made my skin tight and that’s it.
Output:negative
Input:Only 0.34mL of powder in each container. I cannot get it smooth for the life of me. I am using extremely thin coats, but it isn't drying. When filing, it just peels up, despite waiting for minutes for it to dry (instructions say it should only take seconds). I've used 1 color so far, but it isn't accurate to the pictures. It only lasts a couple of days before it begins to chip, nowhere near the 21 days that the company says it lasts. It makes my throat and eyes burn. The top coat isn't that shiny. I have used other powder dip kits and they are so much better.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this for my son because he wants to have a nice full beard like all the men in our family.<br /> I thought this might make it nice and smooth like his granddad. He has been using the oil for a little over a week and his GF says she can tell the difference already. It is softer and smells real nice too.
Output:positive
Input:I love the idea of having a floss card. I was so excited to get them. I do not like it. It says that they are lightly waxed but feels like they are not at all. It feels uncomfortable to try to get in between your teeth. I have had braces and my teeth are close together and I cannot get it though my teeth. It gets stuck and always breaks. My mother in the other hand LOVES it. She has never has braces and her teeth aren’t quite as close together.
Output:negative
Input:Product is exactly as described except it sat on a shelf somewhere for 2 years before it was sold to me.<br /><br />The FDA says sunscreen is good for 3 years from the date of manufacture, so imagine my surprise when my 6 bottle arrived with less then 6 months before the expiration date. I reached out to the manufacturer directly to confirm the bottles I received in 7/22 were made in 1/20.<br /><br />It is not ok to sell old and dated product to a customer without a proper heads up to them first that the product you have is not as expected- new. Sunscreen has a shelf life just like food does, even if the shelf life is 3 years, and I wouldn't have bought 6 bottles at once if they were only going to be good for 6 months. I feel this is a dishonest sales trick to sell off their old inventory to unsuspecting customers and am not happy about my purchase from this company.

Output:negative
Input:I liked how many boxes came with this, but when you open the individual boxes, they are NOT the razors I ordered. The box says Derby Premium, but they are boxes full of the regular derby professional blades that usually come in the green box. You can tell by the paper wrapping on each blade. They don't even cut the same as the real derby premiums. Price is too good to be true for a reason.
Output:negative
Input:My husband says it smells like rotten eggs, when I used on a small area it seem to work but then when I tried the rest of my leg it didn't take anything off. I was using my fingers to spread the liquid until I realized that my fingers wore hurting, they got swollen.
Output:negative
Input:This is a great kit with lots of pieces and paint.  The colors are primary and secondary so colors will have to be mixed to get the natural colors that dinosaurs may have been.  The brushes are the usual kit brushes.<br /><br />This project toy says ages 4 to 8.  My grandson is nine and I'm debating whether to give it to him right now or wait another six months.  He loves pulling out similar toys like this when he comes over. His favorite dinosaur is the triceratops which was the first thing I looked for before ordering.<br /><br />As far as the painting, I really see this for an older child. The play part is definitely more my grandson's maturity level.
Output:positive
Input:I wish I could give these no stars. The clips that came with it are useless and I'm left with such a big mess and it doesn't work. It looks like all the good reviews they had were paid reviews. Almost all of them are lengthy and explains u how to use it and says they got it in hide discount. Who has time to write all that stuff except for paid reviewers. Plz don't go for the reviews. This is a rip off.
Output:negative
Input:It says mirror effect but honestly it’s just like silver, gold and bronze polish. It doesn’t look like mirror or chrome at all. I would not recommend buying this product if you wanted the mirror/chrome effect nail polish.
Output:negative
Input:You will not receive the same scents pictured and it is extremely misleading as it says it low down in the description. I did not like my scents at all. Mine also came without caps and were leaking.<br />Seller gave me a 33% refund.
Output:negative
Input:Doesn’t fit on a standard size hair dryer. I tried so hard to get it to fit but it won’t budge whatsoever. The photo is a little misleading. I initially thought the bottom part where the River part is was flexible enough to fit (since it says UNIVERSAL)but tough enough to hold while In use. It does not fit whatsoever and is a little cheaply made. So I have no use for it! 😞
Output:negative
Input:This shampoo smells like the stuff often used when I’m at the salon- very fresh and clean, with a very mild hint of floral. Be aware this is a purple color depositing shampoo. Meaning, you are literally depositing small amounts of purple dye to your hair when you shampoo and condition. The purple dye color cancels out brassy orange colors that develop on blond and silver hair. You should not use this as a daily/maintenance shampoo. Depending on your hair, this (or any purple shampoo) could dye your hair a cotton candy purple (I had it happen with another brand that my friend had imported from Eastern Europe). With this shampoo, my first wash I did not notice any difference in my hair, but the second wash there was a definite difference. It’s not terribly noticeable in my photo, but there is a slight purple sheen to my silver/greys. My hair felt soft after and was manageable.<br />Another thing to be aware, this product is made in China. Label says “Made in PRC”, which is short for People’s Republic of China. Current price is $19.95, which is good for a purple shampoo and conditioner that works of this size.

Ġends,Ġstay,"Input:Let start by saying that I spend a lot of money buying hair products for my unruly and mix hair. I am half black and half Spanish and my hair is freezy, dry,  straight roots and curly ends. I used Chi, Redken and any product with good reviews. I washed my hair twice this week already and I can tell the difference. From the moment I put the shampoo on my hand I could feel the smooth and Silky texture. I was surprise how easy it was to detangle my hair without using any additional product. Because of the recurre if my hair I had to use my Suave keratin leave on conditioner to straighten it, but still I could feel the difference. My hair is smooth, shiny and smells amazing. I will recommend it.
Output:positive
Input:For the price it does exactly what you need it to do! Very easy to use, anyone can use this device! Just section hair, put each end onto device ends, and push button to twist. Done!
Output:positive
Input:Not worth the money.  I've had pack hair that was better.  Spilt ends all over the hair. Ugh. Wish I never bought it
Output:negative
Input:First off, this is NOT Human hair. This is synthetic. I wish I could get my money back, but the hair came a day before my appointment. The texture of the hair after a couple of days is nasty. It feels matted at the ends and you aren’t able to curl it. The hair doesn’t look nothing like the picture.
Output:negative
Input:To many flyaway ends in the piece they stick out everywhere. Color matched almost perfect and looks like real hair.
Output:negative
Input:The curl pattern is decent but the bundles shed worse than any curly hair I’ve ever had and the ends are very thin
Output:negative
Input:I got this wig for my mannequin head. When I took the wig out the pack it felt rough and smell weird. The ends were thick and a little tangled. I washed the wig and it smells better now and a little softer. If your looking to buy this for personal use I don’t think you should waste your money just invest in a human hair wig. If you want it for a mannequin then it’s cool
Output:negative
Input:I buy clip-in hair to add color depth and a little bit of drama, so this is not a review to add length.  This hair is perfect to blend in with fine hair or hair that is smooth (looks like you can use right out of the package). The hair has healthy ""bounce"" or body.<br /><br />This is a review of 1B/8A/22 (dark black going to 8ash with 22 medium blonde mix)<br /><br />This hair provides hard to achieve drama, going from deep dark brown/black to a lighter shade, without ANY brassiness.  This is nearly impossible to achieve on real hair (without ruining the cuticle), yet they did it and the hair appears HEALTHY.<br /><br />The hair also appears relatively thick on the ends, unlike another recent purchase I made.<br /><br />NOTE: Sadly, I might be returning this, so I did not disassemble the hair pieces from the package or even try these on (because another reader might receive my return).  Right now, I'm undecided.<br /><br />Defining color over the internet is difficult  The ends are supposed to be #22 with 8A.  In the picture, it looks like a light blonde of 8.5 or even maybe a 9.  I decided to roll the dice in hopes that the picture would be more accurate than the description.  Upon receipt, this is a medium blonde that even leans a bit dark blonde...perhaps a level 7.5 at the lightest last few inches.<br /><br />My natural hair color is a medium brown and I bleach it to a level 9.5.  Uniformly bleached hair, especially right after a root touch-up can make the face look washed out.  So this would have been perfect to add some interest and depth except I fear that the medium blonde-dark blonde will detract from the nearly platinum hair that I've worked hard to achieve.<br /><br />This color is versatile and would be great for someone with medium blonde hair or any shade *darker*.  Unfortunately, for someone with level 9 or above, probably best to shop for a level 9 or 10 ombre.<br /><br />Bummer, I really think this is gorgeous hair but it will not work for me.
Output:positive
Input:There are a couple of issues that I had with this scrub:<br />1) The abrasion grains are a little too big and also I feel like there are too few of them given how much cream there is, so it ends up being that half of your cheek might have some of them and the other half not.<br />2) It left a very greasy feeling, unfortunately. As soon as I applied the cream to my face it felt like I was rubbing on Crisco, which is definitely not desirable in my case because I already have oily skin.<br />3) It didn't seem to help actually remove any dead skin, if anything it felt like it just clogged up my pores more.<br /><br />Overall: Not for me, but maybe it would be more appropriate for someone with extremely dry skin.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Output:negative
Input:I have thin, fine hair and this answers my problem.  I spray a little on the back and top of my hair and after drying, I spray some on the front side ends to give them some stability without heaviness.  I ordered 4 bottles because my usual store no longer carries this.
Output:positive
Input:Rough hair, hard to bond ends
Output:negative
Input:Each extension was extremely thin and blended very badly with my real hair. My hair is not even that thick but it was definitely not enough to look remotely realistic. But even if you were to get more, you wouldn't have enough room on your head because you would need so many to make the ends look thicker and they take up a lot of room on the scalp
Output:negative
Input:love this hairspray as it doesn't dry the ends and holds quite well.  Need to give a second spray to hold the hair properly but love its non sticky finish
Output:positive
Input:Its sheds ALOT! The cap was big so it bunches. Also it's uneven layers with split ends.
Output:negative
Input:These bands weren't long enough - when wrapped around my head, the ends barely met.  I returned this item.
Output:negative

It feels matted at the liquid and you aren’t able to curl it. The hair doesn’t look nothing like the picture.
Output:negative
Input:To many flyaway make in the piece they stick out everywhere. Color matched almost perfect and looks like real hair.
Output:negative
Input:The curl pattern is decent but the bundles shed worse than any curly hair I’ve ever had and the like are very thin
Output:negative
Input:I got this wig for my mannequin head. When I took the wig out the pack it felt rough and smell weird. The own were thick and a little tangled. I washed the wig and it smells better now and a little softer. If your looking to buy this for personal use I don’t think you should waste your money just invest in a human hair wig. If you want it for a mannequin then it’s cool
Output:negative
Input:I buy clip-in hair to add color depth and a little bit of drama, so this is not a review to add length.  This hair is perfect to blend in with fine hair or hair that is smooth (looks like you can use right out of the package). The hair has healthy ""bounce"" or body.<br /><br />This is a review of 1B/8A/22 (dark black going to 8ash with 22 medium blonde mix)<br /><br />This hair provides hard to achieve drama, going from deep dark brown/black to a lighter shade, without ANY brassiness.  This is nearly impossible to achieve on real hair (without ruining the cuticle), yet they did it and the hair appears HEALTHY.<br /><br />The hair also appears relatively thick on the last, unlike another recent purchase I made.<br /><br />NOTE: Sadly, I might be returning this, so I did not disassemble the hair pieces from the package or even try these on (because another reader might receive my return).  Right now, I'm undecided.<br /><br />Defining color over the internet is difficult  The This are supposed to be #22 with 8A.  In the picture, it looks like a light blonde of 8.5 or even maybe a 9.  I decided to roll the dice in hopes that the picture would be more accurate than the description.  Upon receipt, this is a medium blonde that even leans a bit dark blonde...perhaps a level 7.5 at the lightest last few inches.<br /><br />My natural hair color is a medium brown and I bleach it to a level 9.5.  Uniformly bleached hair, especially right after a root touch-up can make the face look washed out.  So this would have been perfect to add some interest and depth except I fear that the medium blonde-dark blonde will detract from the nearly platinum hair that I've worked hard to achieve.<br /><br />This color is versatile and would be great for someone with medium blonde hair or any shade *darker*.  Unfortunately, for someone with level 9 or above, probably best to shop for a level 9 or 10 ombre.<br /><br />Bummer, I really think this is gorgeous hair but it will not work for me.
Output:positive
Input:There are a couple of issues that I had with this scrub:<br />1) The abrasion grains are a little too big and also I feel like there are too few of them given how much cream there is, so it these up being that half of your cheek might have some of them and the other half not.<br />2) It left a very greasy feeling, unfortunately. As soon as I applied the cream to my face it felt like I was rubbing on Crisco, which is definitely not desirable in my case because I already have oily skin.<br />3) It didn't seem to help actually remove any dead skin, if anything it felt like it just clogged up my pores more.<br /><br />Overall: Not for me, but maybe it would be more appropriate for someone with extremely dry skin.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Output:negative
Input:I have thin, fine hair and this answers my problem.  I spray a little on the back and top of my hair and after drying, I spray some on the front side When to give them some stability without heaviness.  I ordered 4 bottles because my usual store no longer carries this.
Output:positive
Input:Rough hair, hard to bond One
Output:negative
Input:Each extension was extremely thin and blended very badly with my real hair. My hair is not even that thick but it was definitely not enough to look remotely realistic. But even if you were to get more, you wouldn't have enough room on your head because you would need so many to make the less look thicker and they take up a lot of room on the scalp
Output:negative
Input:love this hairspray as it doesn't dry the favorite and holds quite well.  Need to give a second spray to hold the hair properly but love its non sticky finish
Output:positive
Input:Its sheds ALOT! The cap was big so it bunches. Also it's uneven layers with split must.
Output:negative
Input:These bands weren't long enough - when wrapped around my head, the ends barely met.  I returned this item.
Output:negative

Ġshort,Ġdown,"Input:The PROS:  This product does exactly what it says it will:  it stiffens the hair so that it will stand up straight, which is why it is ideal for Flat Tops. It is not heavily perfumed, like a lot of hair products on the market these days.  It has a very slight fragrance in the jar, but once you put it in your hair it is practically  undetectable.  Even though the jar is small, it will last a long time because you only need to use a little bit at a time.<br /><br />The CONS:  Because this product is petroleum-based, it is very heavy and sticky.  In fact, it has almost the same consistency as Vasaline..perhaps a little bit thicker.  Shampooing it out of your hair is like trying to clean up an oil spill.  It will stay in your hair for a few days unless you use dish detergent (DAWN) to wash it out with.<br />Also, if your hair is more than about 1 1/2 inches in length, it will make your hair look greasy and stringy.  As the label states, it is best suited for very short hair.
Output:negative
Input:I pulled a tendon in my arm and found I could not hold a heavy portable dryer. This was before COVID......so I went to Walmart and bought the lightest weight hair dryer I could find. It did not satisfy me. I found this on Amazon. It had several attachments including the not frizzy nozzle which is a must. I only have one problem with it. It has a short handle and if you accidentally cover all of it with your hand, it will shut off. I have learned to be more careful. I'm thankful items like this have a safety shut off.

Input:So I was super skeptical on the color because I felt the people who posted photos didn’t capture the color of the wig well enough for me to see if it was worth it, although so many reviews said this was great quality so I but the bullet, I absolutely love the color and the fit, not to heavy, not to tight and not to loose, has adjustable strap in the back, I will admit the bangs do need trimmed at least for me but I was glad they were a little long so I could shape them how I’d like it to fit my face vs. being to short... in love with this for the price!!

Input:Nothing as pictured and I was sent something stapled shut so it was already a return once I'm very not happy!!! Way to short fit is for a child!
Output:negative
Input:Not a true human hair: too silky and tangles from the get go. Too much short hair inside the 28 inch hair
Output:negative
Input:The product was extremely small and difficult to use on short hair.  The chalk was very dense and you had to press very hard to get it to apply to the hair with color you could see.
Output:negative
Input:It broke within an hour of having in my hair that is short and not thick !!<br />Poor product
Output:negative
Input:Great Product....even for my short beard.  There is a slight scent of the oil itself but it disappears rather quickly once on the beard.  I will buy this product again when I run out.

Input:This pen was harsh. It was very rough to the touch which wasn't as much an issue until you had to bear down to get any lint to show up on your brow. Also, you had to push so much that it ended up looking like a thick line rather than 3 lines and more hair-like even with short strokes.  Great idea and nice product with poor execution.
Output:negative
Input:My hair is fine. Conditioner makes it flat, so I don't use it.  This is absolutely the answer to my problem.  After shampooing and towel-drying, I spray this on generously.  It actually feels nice, not heavy or greasy.  I then blow dry just a short time, leaving my hair still damp.  When it's dry, I style with my curling brush and my hair looks good. I use a little hairspray too.  Using this, along with getting my hair colored every 2 to 3 months gives my hair texture.  It is a relief to feel better about my hair.  I won't be without this now.  I bought it first from my hairdresser, and then I saw it on Amazon, so that's where I buy it now.  I love it.
Output:positive
Input:As someone who gets sew ins and order hair from Amazon often, I would say this hair is decent if you need something for a short amount of time. I usually wear sew ins go 2-3 months, so it’s not great for that. The first 30-60 days, it looked awesome, it was thick, and easy to style but after that it, it started to tangle and get unmanageable. I washed it to restore it and it looked great for a week or so and then the quality deteriorated again. I highly recommend this hair if you need something cheap and for a shorter time frame.
Output:positive
Input:I love the size of this brush, but it's too soft to use on a beard, unless your beard is very short.
Output:negative
Input:Although stylish, this clamp is for short or thin hair, or small amounts of hairs. It claims to be for ""thick"" hair but this is not true at all.
Output:negative
Input:I bought these for my mom.  Within a short period of time the decorative leaf came off of one clip.  It is only attached with a very small portion of the clip.  I contacted the seller and replaced the item.  While I appreciate the replacement, it is a bit of a hassle to deal with a return...especially of a gift.

Ġback,ĠThese,"Input:I purchased these in hopes that it would be easier to tuck my hair back. When I received the product, they were all laid out and flat. I opened the one that I would most likely use the most and followed the video of how to properly use it, but it only pulled on my hair, the wire feels like a poorly made coat hanger, and it didn't look anything like the images or video provided. I would not recommend this to anyone with long hair. I only rated 2 stars because I do like the colors and patterns.
Output:negative
Input:After a brief search for a beard trimmer, I chose the Norelco based on product reputation and model features.  This trimmer does a decent job and has some nice features.  What ruined it for me (literally) was the difficulty removing and re-inserting the trimmer adjuster.  I had to tug and cajole to take it off and had even a worse time putting it back on (which relies on an exact line-up of the plastic tabs).  The thing finally broke and I pitched the trimmer in disgust.<br /><br />I next bought a Remington model 200 trimmer which is much simpler to use and up this point have been happy with it.
Output:negative
Input:I really wanted to like this hair brush. I bought it purely on the design, but it really isn't a sturdy hair brush...it feels really cheap and possibly was 3D printed. The center bristle part came out and I can pop it back in but if my hair has any tangle in it then it just pops back out again. (Might try a hot glue gun to get it to stay) for the price I paid it was just not worth it
Output:negative
Input:Cap runs small, density not accurate. Sent back immediately so I really can't honestly comment on the hair quality.
Output:negative
Input:The best eyelash curler I ever had. I read the other reviews about using a hair dryer on it. It is a cool trick to curl your lashes but just be careful because if you get it a little too hot the metal will burn you. Maybe use the hair dryer on it for about a half a minute and then shake it and blow on it before you curl your lashes. This  eyelash curler doesn't pull out my lashes like the cheap ones I would buy at CVS. Actually my eyelashes curl back in little curls when I use it but after I'll put on some clear mascara and some lengthening mascara and my comb and they come out long
Output:positive
Input:I thought I would like this.  My hairstylist used one on me and it gave a nice soft wave.  I couldn't get this one to do anything.  I am sending it back.
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:c9d5b52ea622391fc5c69045ff87a58]] This box was already opened , seal was broken. Tried to mix the settled polish, by rolling even shaking and it just won’t mix. Definitely sending back. I’ll order from another seller.
Output:negative

Output:negative
Input:I loved this straightener when I first got it. It occasionally would tug my hair but did a good overall job. And the only way I could turn it off was to unplug it.<br />A few weeks after receiving it I started having trouble turning it on. With persistence it would finally come on & heat up. Then I noticed it starting to lose heat. I’d set it for 410 & if I was more than 2 minutes coming back to use it, it would be down in the high 200s to low 300s. As soon as I picked it up it would start to increase back to 410. I gave 2 stars because technically I can still use it but it’s sure a pain in the butt!
Output:negative
Input:Didn't work. Had to send it back because it wouldn't turn on.
Output:negative
Input:Do you things are helpful especially if you’re doing poly gel nails, helps prevent air pockets from happening. They do however allow some air still in because they aren’t super tight which is good because you don’t want to hurt your nail. Came with 10 so just in case they break you have back ups or if you want to use them on all 10 fingers at once you can do that too as well. It does allow the poly gel to cure underneath the UV light pretty well does not block or prevent anything from curing. They are a handy tool to have especially if you’re a beginner or doing nails on yourself.
Output:positive
Input:Works like a charm is light weight and reaches your entire back
Output:positive
Input:Absolutely love this product.  The only downfall is that the top of the pump came off.  It doesn't look broken, just popped off and will not go back on.  So, I'm stuck with getting the product out by shaking and squeezing the container.  I'll never buy it again for that reason.
Output:positive
Input:Wow!! I couldn’t even be near this stuff. It really smelled.<br />Thankfully,I got my money back.<br />If you are sensitive to smells, this is NOT for you. Major strong chemical smell
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:fe1cd327055b7706b69b35e488c1e6a]] First off I’m only giving a star because I have to It was soft but thin and not true to length I ordered a 12inch and it looked more like a 10 inch also it was blunt cut the front was longer than the back and idk if some hairs was synthetic because when my flat iron hit it some of the hairs close to the root would stribble  up like braiding hair but it was Thanksgiving so I pulled this wig off and made the best of it 😘

Ġtoo,Ġanyone,"Input:Reordered once it was back in stock. Have used for several years. It’s not a heavy mask-like product. Perfect for my fine hair with no buildup. My hair grows slowly so I think it’s giving me that extra boost. Smells nice too, not overly scented. I also use the leave in growth spray afterwards. Better alternative than harsh growth chemicals for me.
Output:positive

Input:I found the Kangaroo Keeper locally, so didn't have to pay the exorbitant shipping they want online.  Nice idea but it falls flat.  Or rather it falls in a bunch unless you keep it stuffed with tall items.  I knew about this flaw from reading reviews so I bought it with the intention of reinforcing with coat hanger wire.  Now mine has a frame to hold it UP (the way it LOOKS in the pictures!) and a frame around the top to keep it open.  It took me a good hour to do this upgrade, but now I can use purses that I was about to throw away because they're too deep (and dark) to find things.  I say, don't bother with this item.  It looks like there are better designed ones out there.

Output:negative
Input:Update: Jan 2023<br />The bottle I bought recently dried my skin out at first use. And repeated use made my face red.<br /> It’s awful! I don’t know whether they changed or my skin changed.<br /><br />Old review:<br />I tried the cereal version. It's a perfectly good foam wash, but not that much better than less expensive options.<br /><br />The bottle is misleading, too. The grains at the bottom are decorative and enclosed in a bottom. The pump will not draw the liquid from that bottom section, and since I could not get the top unscrewed, t felt as though some was wasted.
Output:negative
Input:Very nice quality! Perfect size. I use these in making my own cleaning products using essential oils. I have recommended these to friends and family. They purchased them too after seeing mine. I’ll be buying more soon.<br />The sprayers work extremely well

Input:It is often claimed that periorbital dark circles are caused by tiredness or working too hard or even just staying up late. While this can be true, the truth is that your genes play a huge role here. So what exactly is happening when you get dark circles under or around your eyes?<br /><br />Simply put, periorbital dark circles are a result of the thin layer of skin below your eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood they contain more clearly than anywhere else on your body. (For reference, this skin around your eyelids, called periorbital skin, is on average about 0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about 2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)<br /><br />Now, as you may or may not already know, the reason veins often look blue isn’t because the blood inside them is blue; it’s because your skin/subcutaneous tissue only lets blue/violet wavelengths of light pass through it. As a result, only blue light is reflected back and the veins look, well, bluish. (Veins often won’t appear blue if a person has darker or lighter skin. Rather, the veins tend to appear green or brown. On the other hand, people with extremely light skin, such as albinos, will typically have veins that show up as dark purple or dark red, more closely resembling the actual color of the blood running through the veins.)<br /><br />It’s the exact same concept with the skin below your eyes. Those dark bluish circles are (usually) just the result of light being reflected back off of the blood vessels sitting just below the surface of that incredibly thin patch of skin. This is the same reason facial bruises are more prominent below or around the eyes; the thin skin just shows the blood from the ruptured blood vessels a little bit more clearly.<br /><br />Again, as you may or may not know, as we age, our skin loses its elasticity and ability to regenerate and as a result, it becomes thinner. This is why more often than not, elderly people will have rather prominent periorbital dark circles regardless of how much they sleep. As with those who are genetically predisposed to having thinner skin below the eyes, it’s just biology.
Output:positive
Input:These are like child size! Even if I were to cut my nails to the skin they’re still too small.

Ġstart,Ġquality,"Input:Please do not waste your time on this product unless of course if your looking for a expensive pumice stone that you'll end up with frustration from the charging cable you'll get wrapped up in! Where to start... It doesn't hold a charge longer then 5 minutes and the epilater, please unless your big foot and haven't shaved  in a few years then maybe it'll tweeze a few hairs! Shaver is more time consuming and you still end up having to use a razor!  Please save your time and disappointment for men not this pretty but useless gadget
Output:negative
Input:These bows were purchased as part of a donation to a shelter for abused and neglected children. The children were very happy to have new hair accessories for the start of school.
Output:positive
Input:sorry, didn't hold up.<br />great fragrance, but left me stinking by the end of the day.<br />shaved my arm pits, cleaned with rubbing alchohol to give the product a true start. nope, dosen't protect for men.  very disappointed.  Going back to schmidt's
Output:negative
Input:I'm not overreacting when I say that this is my favorite conditioner ever!! I have mixed hair (oily scalp/dry ends from hair coloring) that is not easy to condition, not any conditioner does it for me, but this little bar does wonders for my ends! From the moment that I start rubbing it on my ends, and combing my hair with my fingers, I can feel the softness. Once I'm out of the shower, it's really easy to comb my hair without any tangles. It's so effective and the smell is lovely!
Output:positive
Input:This would have been perfect, but I failed to read the directions that said to press the button to lower the brush, and brush the dogs fur first.  I didn't press that button, and the dog got just the powerful suction from my vacuum cleaner.  It frightened her, and now I have to start over getting her used to the vacuum.  Otherwise, this attachment was perfect.  Gave it 4 stars only because people tend to read the comments of those review....and, I wanted to emphasize that the product was good.  My bad.
Output:positive
Input:Let me start by saying my hair is almost completely white. These little combs leave almost no color in my hair. Damp or dry didn't matter. The only way these things leave any color is to take the ""chalk"" out of the comb and rake it through your hair directly. Even then the color is light. In my opinion this is a sub-standard product.
Output:negative
Input:This product is a great idea but I do not think you can start using it when your kid is more than 1 cause they take it off. I bought this for my 2 year old son and as soon as I put it on he took it off and ran away. So I haven't been able to use it at all.
Output:negative
Input:It does not work for me even though I don't lot of grey hair. Its very itchy. Takes long time to see the result and you start to see the grey hair back after few days. It's like it start to come off every time you shower or clean your face with water. I don't recommend it.
Output:negative
Input:Where do I start? I got the wig today and I opened the package to find a completely different wig. There wasn’t any lace to cut off what so ever and it looks and feels very plastic and fake. BEWARE this is not the wig that is being advertised in the videos. I think is a more cheaper version of the previous $50 wig and is selling it for $20. They need to let people know and take these old videos and pictures down. The color is very pretty but that’s about all, the wig feels and look like a cheap cosplay wig. You definitely get what you pay for. If you’re looking at the videos and pictures hoping to get what the rest got, you won’t.<br /><br />These pictures are of the wig straight out of the packaging.
Output:negative
Input:Overall it is a good case .. I just recently<br />Threw it away cuz as my business grew I had to build but .. this lasted for about 7 months before the handle broke completely<br />Off and the door parts start to get uneven and fail to close tightly so .. yea it’s no super sturdy but it got the job done for the time I did have it.
Output:positive
Input:Overall, the product is okay. It glides onto the skin nicely. It feels silky smooth (thanks to the silicones in it). But, my skin doesn’t feel extra hydrated, I haven’t noticed any difference after using it for a month, let alone 7 days. I don’t like rating things based on price, but when it comes to something at this price point, I feel like it’s going to play a part in the decision, at least for me it would. And for me, the ingredients and effects resulting from this product just aren’t there to justify this price point. Honestly, even if it was way cheaper (like $20), I still wouldn’t purchase it. There’s so many great skincare products out there that are waaaaaay cheaper that I’ve actually seen results from. So, I can’t recommend this.<br /><br />I wanted to love this.....<br /><br />A serum for $171 (at the time of writing this review), I figured this had to have some pretty special stuff in it. I mean, it must have some kind of magic potion in it that reverses time and makes me look like I’m 20 years old again. Right? I mean, it’s gotta have something pretty darn special in it to price it so high and expect people to pay it. Plus, it’s not even from a brand I had ever heard anything about, so it wasn’t just some name brand that was what would hike the price up...You know, how some companies just feel like since their brand is well known and popular that they can slap their name on their products and it doesn’t matter if there’s nothing in them or about them that would account for the price other than the brand name?! Yeah, well as far as I know this isn’t a well known, or even known brand, so that’s definitely not the reason for the high price. So that means there has to be something in it that makes it worth a higher price. And it has to be something amazing to make it worth a price as high as $171 for 1.7 oz of product! Right?! Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />The info for this product on the Amazon product page is seriously LACKING! On the top of the product page where there’s usually some bullet points with info, there’s nothing. You scroll down a little and there’s a small paragraph. It claims to “rejuvenate your skin in 7 days.” That’s a HUGE claim! Most skin care product I use and have tried usually say to use consistently for a month or so before you’ll see results. So, to claim to see results in 7 days is huge. Looking at this product on the company’s website, it states that clinical tests were done “under dermatological control on 29 volunteers aged between 35 and 60, including sensitive skin.” It states that 81% had “skin more radiant, luminous and revitalised ,” 81% had “visibly rejuvenated skin,” and “in 1 month all the signs of aging are visibly corrected.” Again, some HUGE claims, but it seems 81% is the lucky number 🤨<br /><br />The ingredients weren’t included on the product page. All it says is, “The new anti-ageing serum includes an innovative active ingredient that multiplies by 8 the power of absorption(2) of your skin, making the serum penetrate deeper.” Ummmm....what?! I don’t know about you, but that description is not helpful in any way! I’m not even totally sure I get what it’s trying to say. It includes an innovative active ingredient....why not say what that innovative active ingredient is? This innovative active ingredient multiplies by 8 the power of absorption of your skin. What on earth is that supposed to mean? “...multiplies by 8 the power of absorption of your skin...” I take it to mean that this ingredient multiplies the absorption of your skin by the power of 8, so 8 times. Looking at the company’s website and the info for this product on there, most of it says the same things but some parts are said differently, which makes it seem clearer, at least to me. It states, “...includes an innovative active ingredient that increases 8 times the power of absorption(2) of your skin making the serum penetrate deeper...” So, that definitely makes me think it’s saying it increases absorption of your skin 8 times. But, it just would be nice if they stated that in a way that was a little clearer.<br /><br />The paragraph description on the product page also says that the innovative active ingredient that increases the absorption power of your skin 8 times makes “the serum penetrate deeper and activate the capacity of self-protection during the day and unfold all its power of regeneration by night, working in a synchronized way and thus achieving more visible results in less time.” It does state you use the serum morning and night. But, I wondered how the heck the serum would know to work differently in the day than it does at night. How would it know to activate self-protection during the day and start regenerating at night? It states that, “At night, when you sleep and while your skin is more receptive, it repairs damage, reactivates cellular regeneration and rejuvenates your skin. By day it increases the resistance of cells to oxidative stress and protects the skin defending it against external aggression.” Again, I don’t really see how it would know to do something different at night than it does during the day? But, I’m not a scientist so it could just be beyond my understanding!<br /><br />It sure would be nice to know what they believe is this innovative ingredient, because looking at the Amazon product page it doesn’t mention much, let alone what this innovative ingredient is. Looking at the product on the company’s website it states “NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY FORMULA. 22 ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.” It goes on to state that the serum incorporates “Glyco 8-Power biomolecules that generate small vesicles that trap inside them the active ingredients of the formula. Their great affinity for the lipids of the skin make them penetrate easily, liberating the content inside, increasing by 8 the capacity of absorption and multiplying the benefits of the serum on your skin.” I have no clue what “glyco 8-power biomolecules” are and doing a search on Google doesn’t explain it either. All that shows up is this serum. I’m not sure if the “innovative ingredient” is supposed to be the “glyco 8-power biomolecules?”<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Let’s take a look at this products ingredients...<br /><br />Antioxidant Ingredients: Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)<br /><br />Cell-Communicating Ingredient: Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)<br /><br />Skin Brightening Ingredients: Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract<br /><br />Skin-Identical Ingredients: Glycerin, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3<br /><br />Soothing Ingredients: Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol<br /><br />Antimicrobial/Antibacterial Ingredients: Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Alcohol, O-Cymen-5-Ol<br /><br />Moisturizer/Humectant Ingredients: Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dimethiconol, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Soluble Collagen, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sorbitol<br /><br />Perfuming: Ethoxydiglycol, Fragrance<br /><br />Preservative: Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, O-Cymen-5-Ol<br /><br />Theres a total of 57 ingredients.<br /><br />Theres 3 ingredients that I consider great (superstar) ingredients - glycerin, licorice root extract, and Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract.<br /><br />There’s 18 ingredients that I consider to be good - sunflower seed oil, hydrogenated lecithin, bifida ferment lysate, milk protein, squalane, vitamin E, Shea butter extract, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, soluble collagen, Polygonum cuspidatum root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, centella asiatica extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, rosemary leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, retinyl palmitate, and Panthenol.<br /><br />Even though there’s a total of 21 great and good ingredients, that is less than half of the ingredients. In a product as high priced as this, I expect a lot more great (superstar) type ingredients. To get me to pay $171 (at the time of writing this review) for a skincare product, it needs to have way more than 3 ingredients that I consider superstar ingredients.<br /><br />Plus, there’s 4 different silicones and alcohol in this product, which is pretty unacceptable for a skincare product at this price point.<br /><br />There’s also fragrance in it. It’s the last ingredient. It has a very faint smell. I can’t quite place it. Kind of perfume scented, but very faint.<br /><br />In the end, I just don’t see where they come up with the price point for this. I feel that way about a lot of the so-called “big name brand” products, where just because they’re a well-known brand, they feel it justifies slapping a bigger price on it, even when the ingredients and/or results don’t seem to justify it. But, this brand isn’t even a known brand, unless you’re a small spa or boutique as far as I can tell. So, that definitely doesn’t justify the price (not that I think it would even if it was a well known brand). But, the ingredients also don’t justify the price. There isn’t enough superstar type ingredients in this to justify the price. There’s a bunch of basic good ingredients, and a few superstar, and then some not great ingredients like fragrance, alcohol, and different silicones. I find that unacceptable when you’re trying to charge this much. Not to mention, they claim results occur in 7 days. I used this for a month and didn’t see any results at all. I don’t even feel like it provides much hydration. It just feels silky smooth on the skin...thanks to the silicones. So, I don’t recommend this.

Input:This little gadget is awesome.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it took me some time to get acquainted with the settings and how they function.  I did read the manual which was helpful but in the end it was trial and error that got me through it.  Basically, if anything on screen is blinking that particular feature is in set up mode. You click the opposite button to then opt out and go on to the next feature.  The features are R, L, Temperature and Time.  Don't worry this review will clarify a few of your questions.  Once you get past how to operate the settings, it works great!  It is automatically is set to start on Celsius. The hottest temperature is 200 degrees Celsius which is the same as 390 degrees Fahrenheit.  Since I use it on the hottest temperature I leave it on 200 degrees Celsius so I don't have to change it to Fahrenheit all of the time.  If you want to change it to Fahrenheit you can do this by clicking both buttons together 4 times.  What I didn't know until after I used it is that you can change the direction in how the curling iron rolls, either clockwise or counter clockwise.  This is represented with an L for Left and a R for Right.  So next time I am going to reverse from L to R when I curl the other side of my hair.  Pretty neat.  Another thing to note is that you have to choose how many seconds you want to curl your hair.  I choose 8 seconds.  The roller will spin your hair for about 6 seconds and then stop. Do not pull your hair out yet.  It will begin to start beeping until the amount of time you selected is over.  The beeping will stop and this is when you can easily release the button and pull your hair out. If you abide by this feature you will ensure that you get even curls all around your head.  It works best when you use small bundles of hair at a time.  I tried to be lazy and my hair got caught up in it.  If this happens don't panic.  This device is actually really user friendly.  Just release the button and slowly push it and release, push and release until it unrolls your hair. Do not just yank your hair out.  I curled my hair at work during my break time.  I charged it at my desk with PC.  It was so simple that I did not require a mirror.  It was so convenient.  I loved not having cords to mess with.  It takes about 4hrs to fully charge.  Once fully charged it will last  about an hour.  It only took me 10-15 minutes to curl my hair but I noticed that I can only use twice without charging it or it will run out of power.  For this reason I make sure to charge it after each use so that it's ready for when I need it.  Make sure to unplugged it after it's fully charge so that you don't ruin the lithium battery.  If you do forget to charge it and run out of power it will operate if it's plugged in with a USB cord.  It is portable, lightweight and the outer casing does not get hot to the touch.  Not once did I fear I was going to burn my neck or hand. Love this!  Oh also, it will automatically shut off after 10 minutes if you forget to turn it off.  I highly recommend for adults, teenagers and even younger girls.  I just wish the settings will hold in place so that you don't have to go through this step each time before use.  Regardless, I am still on board! A+++  Enjoy!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE:  I am submitting an updated review because the curling iron stopped working after a couple of months.  I do not curl my hair every day and it still broke on me.  During mid-use the digital screen started going out on me and it began making one long continuous ringing noise.  I could not power it off no matter how hard I tried!  I had to put it in another room and let it ring for a couple of hours until the battery died.  I have not tried powering it on again in fear that the same thing will happen again.  It's as good as broken to me and I will not be using it anymore.  It was great while lasted.

Input:This 4 pack of tortoise colored octopus hair clips are not as heavy a plastic as my single purchased one from years ago.  Neither is it as darkly colored.  They also take some finger strength to open.  I have to start it with my other hand.  I do like that they are lighter in weight.  More comfortable to wear and they really hold my hair securely.  I haven't had them long so can't attest to their durability or sturdiness but I like them so far.

Input:Norelco shavers work better for me than anything else. Razors give me ingrown hairs/shaving rash.  So do other brands of electric razors.  When my old Norelco died after 8 years of daily use and much travel, I knew I had to buy another.  This is a basic model--fine for most of us--that shaves close and comfortably.  The only downside is the NiCd battery--you need to charge them properly to maximize the capacity and life.  That was the problem with my old one--too many hotel maids and small children unplugged it after a partial charge, etc., so that finally it didn't hold enough charge to shave with.  When you first start shaving with an electric shaver, your face will need several weeks to adjust, but if you get shaving rash from your razor or current shaver, try a Norelco, they work for me.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Please do not waste your time on this product unless of course if your looking for a expensive pumice stone that you'll end up with frustration from the charging cable you'll get wrapped up in! Where to hands... It doesn't hold a charge longer then 5 minutes and the epilater, please unless your big foot and haven't shaved  in a few years then maybe it'll tweeze a few hairs! Shaver is more time consuming and you still end up having to use a razor!  Please save your time and disappointment for men not this pretty but useless gadget

Input:I'm not overreacting when I say that this is my favorite conditioner ever!! I have mixed hair (oily scalp/dry ends from hair coloring) that is not easy to condition, not any conditioner does it for me, but this little bar does wonders for my ends! From the moment that I found rubbing it on my ends, and combing my hair with my fingers, I can feel the softness. Once I'm out of the shower, it's really easy to comb my hair without any tangles. It's so effective and the smell is lovely!

Input:This would have been perfect, but I failed to read the directions that said to press the button to lower the brush, and brush the dogs fur first.  I didn't press that button, and the dog got just the powerful suction from my vacuum cleaner.  It frightened her, and now I have to pull over getting her used to the vacuum.  Otherwise, this attachment was perfect.  Gave it 4 stars only because people tend to read the comments of those review....and, I wanted to emphasize that the product was good.  My bad.

Input:Let me feels by saying my hair is almost completely white. These little combs leave almost no color in my hair. Damp or dry didn't matter. The only way these things leave any color is to take the ""chalk"" out of the comb and rake it through your hair directly. Even then the color is light. In my opinion this is a sub-standard product.

Input:This product is a great idea but I do not think you can expensive using it when your kid is more than 1 cause they take it off. I bought this for my 2 year old son and as soon as I put it on he took it off and ran away. So I haven't been able to use it at all.
Output:negative
Input:It does not work for me even though I don't lot of grey hair. Its very itchy. Takes long time to see the result and you far to see the grey hair back after few days. It's like it inside to come off every time you shower or clean your face with water. I don't recommend it.

Input:Where do I colors? I got the wig today and I opened the package to find a completely different wig. There wasn’t any lace to cut off what so ever and it looks and feels very plastic and fake. BEWARE this is not the wig that is being advertised in the videos. I think is a more cheaper version of the previous $50 wig and is selling it for $20. They need to let people know and take these old videos and pictures down. The color is very pretty but that’s about all, the wig feels and look like a cheap cosplay wig. You definitely get what you pay for. If you’re looking at the videos and pictures hoping to get what the rest got, you won’t.<br /><br />These pictures are of the wig straight out of the packaging.

Input:Overall, the product is okay. It glides onto the skin nicely. It feels silky smooth (thanks to the silicones in it). But, my skin doesn’t feel extra hydrated, I haven’t noticed any difference after using it for a month, let alone 7 days. I don’t like rating things based on price, but when it comes to something at this price point, I feel like it’s going to play a part in the decision, at least for me it would. And for me, the ingredients and effects resulting from this product just aren’t there to justify this price point. Honestly, even if it was way cheaper (like $20), I still wouldn’t purchase it. There’s so many great skincare products out there that are waaaaaay cheaper that I’ve actually seen results from. So, I can’t recommend this.<br /><br />I wanted to love this.....<br /><br />A serum for $171 (at the time of writing this review), I figured this had to have some pretty special stuff in it. I mean, it must have some kind of magic potion in it that reverses time and makes me look like I’m 20 years old again. Right? I mean, it’s gotta have something pretty darn special in it to price it so high and expect people to pay it. Plus, it’s not even from a brand I had ever heard anything about, so it wasn’t just some name brand that was what would hike the price up...You know, how some companies just feel like since their brand is well known and popular that they can slap their name on their products and it doesn’t matter if there’s nothing in them or about them that would account for the price other than the brand name?! Yeah, well as far as I know this isn’t a well known, or even known brand, so that’s definitely not the reason for the high price. So that means there has to be something in it that makes it worth a higher price. And it has to be something amazing to make it worth a price as high as $171 for 1.7 oz of product! Right?! Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />The info for this product on the Amazon product page is seriously LACKING!

All that shows up is this serum. I’m not sure if the “innovative ingredient” is supposed to be the “glyco 8-power biomolecules?”<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Let’s take a look at this products ingredients...<br /><br />Antioxidant Ingredients: Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)<br /><br />Cell-Communicating Ingredient: Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)<br /><br />Skin Brightening Ingredients: Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract<br /><br />Skin-Identical Ingredients: Glycerin, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3<br /><br />Soothing Ingredients: Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol<br /><br />Antimicrobial/Antibacterial Ingredients: Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Alcohol, O-Cymen-5-Ol<br /><br />Moisturizer/Humectant Ingredients: Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dimethiconol, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Soluble Collagen, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sorbitol<br /><br />Perfuming: Ethoxydiglycol, Fragrance<br /><br />Preservative: Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, O-Cymen-5-Ol<br /><br />Theres a total of 57 ingredients.<br /><br />Theres 3 ingredients that I consider great (superstar) ingredients - glycerin, licorice root extract, and Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract.<br /><br />There’s 18 ingredients that I consider to be good - sunflower seed oil, hydrogenated lecithin, bifida ferment lysate, milk protein, squalane, vitamin E, Shea butter extract, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, soluble collagen, Polygonum cuspidatum root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, centella asiatica extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, rosemary leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, retinyl palmitate, and Panthenol.<br /><br />Even though there’s a total of 21 great and good ingredients, that is less than half of the ingredients. In a product as high priced as this, I expect a lot more great (superstar) type ingredients. To get me to pay $171 (at the time of writing this review) for a skincare product, it needs to have way more than 3 ingredients that I consider superstar ingredients.<br /><br />Plus, there’s 4 different silicones and alcohol in this product, which is pretty unacceptable for a skincare product at this price point.<br /><br />There’s also fragrance in it. It’s the last ingredient. It has a very faint smell. I can’t quite place it. Kind of perfume scented, but very faint.<br /><br />In the end, I just don’t see where they come up with the price point for this. I feel that way about a lot of the so-called “big name brand” products, where just because they’re a well-known brand, they feel it justifies slapping a bigger price on it, even when the ingredients and/or results don’t seem to justify it.

There isn’t enough superstar type ingredients in this to justify the price. There’s a bunch of basic good ingredients, and a few superstar, and then some not great ingredients like fragrance, alcohol, and different silicones. I find that unacceptable when you’re trying to charge this much. Not to mention, they claim results occur in 7 days. I used this for a month and didn’t see any results at all. I don’t even feel like it provides much hydration. It just feels silky smooth on the skin...thanks to the silicones. So, I don’t recommend this.

You click the opposite button to then opt out and go on to the next feature.  The features are R, L, Temperature and Time.  Don't worry this review will clarify a few of your questions.  Once you get past how to operate the settings, it works great!  It is automatically is set to uses on Celsius. The hottest temperature is 200 degrees Celsius which is the same as 390 degrees Fahrenheit.  Since I use it on the hottest temperature I leave it on 200 degrees Celsius so I don't have to change it to Fahrenheit all of the time.  If you want to change it to Fahrenheit you can do this by clicking both buttons together 4 times.  What I didn't know until after I used it is that you can change the direction in how the curling iron rolls, either clockwise or counter clockwise.  This is represented with an L for Left and a R for Right.  So next time I am going to reverse from L to R when I curl the other side of my hair.  Pretty neat.  Another thing to note is that you have to choose how many seconds you want to curl your hair.  I choose 8 seconds.  The roller will spin your hair for about 6 seconds and then stop. Do not pull your hair out yet.  It will begin to go beeping until the amount of time you selected is over.  The beeping will stop and this is when you can easily release the button and pull your hair out. If you abide by this feature you will ensure that you get even curls all around your head.

Once fully charged it will last  about an hour.  It only took me 10-15 minutes to curl my hair but I noticed that I can only use twice without charging it or it will run out of power.  For this reason I make sure to charge it after each use so that it's ready for when I need it.  Make sure to unplugged it after it's fully charge so that you don't ruin the lithium battery.  If you do forget to charge it and run out of power it will operate if it's plugged in with a USB cord.  It is portable, lightweight and the outer casing does not get hot to the touch.  Not once did I fear I was going to burn my neck or hand. Love this!  Oh also, it will automatically shut off after 10 minutes if you forget to turn it off.  I highly recommend for adults, teenagers and even younger girls.  I just wish the settings will hold in place so that you don't have to go through this step each time before use.  Regardless, I am still on board! A+++  Enjoy!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE:  I am submitting an updated review because the curling iron stopped working after a couple of months.  I do not curl my hair every day and it still broke on me.  During mid-use the digital screen started going out on me and it began making one long continuous ringing noise.  I could not power it off no matter how hard I tried!  I had to put it in another room and let it ring for a couple of hours until the battery died.  I have not tried powering it on again in fear that the same thing will happen again.  It's as good as broken to me and I will not be using it anymore.  It was great while lasted.

Input:UPDATE: Less than 2 weeks after receiving my file, it started to malfunction. It wouldn’t stay on and would start and stop on its own, like it had a short.
Output:negative
Input:Norelco shavers work better for me than anything else. Razors give me ingrown hairs/shaving rash.  So do other brands of electric razors.  When my old Norelco died after 8 years of daily use and much travel, I knew I had to buy another.  This is a basic model--fine for most of us--that shaves close and comfortably.  The only downside is the NiCd battery--you need to charge them properly to maximize the capacity and life.  That was the problem with my old one--too many hotel maids and small children unplugged it after a partial charge, etc., so that finally it didn't hold enough charge to shave with.  When you first start shaving with an electric shaver, your face will need several weeks to adjust, but if you get shaving rash from your razor or current shaver, try a Norelco, they work for me.

Ġhome,Ġstyle,"Input:They wouldn't come off the backing. Crap tattoos, used four just to get one to stick and that one took forever to come off. We ended up not using them at all for homecoming. Very disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:Bought this because I had been receiving ASTYM in physical therapy and wanted something similar to use at home. Feels great when used on the arches of feet. More sensitive areas use lighter pressure as this digs in deep.
Output:positive
Input:I have 4 of s-200, one s-320 for my father now. My wife, son and me use one at home, I have one at work. I bought them on Ebay for less than half the retail price, so I can buy more to save the trouble to switch heads. This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way. It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush head regularly like sonicare does. The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new. Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.<br />I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong. The German really did a wonderful engineering job. My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.

Input:Bottle and polish seem kinda cheap but painted well. Dried fast under lamp. I applied 3 coats of polish. Came out pretty good for an at home manicure.

Input:My friend runs an elder care home and she is the one who recommended it to me.  If one of the babies gets a wee bit irritated, I apply Penaten and BOOM, gone in 24 hours.  One granddaughter got heat/diaper rash when camping with her parents.  Penaten knocked it out in 72 hours. My kids think I’m the baby rash whisperer.
Output:positive
Input:Bought this to battle my husband's itchy, flaky scalp [dandruff] and was NOT disappointed!  After only a couple uses, his symptoms improved, and now he is wearing all the black shirts he wants to... without constantly brushing away white dandruff flakes.  On a recent business trip, he used regular shampoo, and the dandruff returned.  But once home again, and using WEN Tea Tree, both the itching and flakes are gone!

Input:This is a beautiful bright sparkly red color. This large jar was on sale for a good price.  I love the Revel dipping powders.  When first trying dipping powders I used a different brand. My nails looked like a toddler did them. I decided to try the Revel brand before I gave up on dipping powders all together and I’m so glad I did. Their liquids are far better and make it so much easier to get a clean professional look at home.
Output:positive
Input:Purchased in April. Stored in interior closet unopened for Halloween. Opened today and it’s a solid block of latex so it’s useless for what I need. Q&A states should last a year if properly stored. To be fair the solid block is the perfect shade of white with very little odor. Latex is strong, flexible, and smooth. If you order use it promptly. The estimated one year of storage is probably under conditions not maintained in the average central heat and air conditioned home.

Input:Let me begin by saying I’ve got at least 10 other colors of this Colourpop eyeshadow. I absolutely love the texture!<br /><br />I received this product securely wrapped in bubble wrap yet it was still cracked and broken. I don’t mind because it’s still usable.<br /><br />That said, the color is very pale. It goes on like shiny white with a hint of opal. To me, there’s not enough depth to it to be anything more than a highlighter under the brow bone or perhaps over a deeper shade. This shade didn’t work for my eyelids.<br /><br />Lastly, it’s less expensive at Ulta and they have testers so you know what you are getting and likely won’t break it on your way home.<br /><br />I won’t return because it’s just too much hassle. But I wouldn’t purchase again. Save money and go to Ulta.

Input:I liked the package, but that was about it.  this ""whipped"" body butter is more like looking at dried up cookie dough.  the jar had a safety seal that was pretty difficult to remove.  once I finally pried it open, I found a tiny spoon drowning in the gritty mess.  after some effort, I managed to release the spoon from the quick sand and dig out some body butter.  It took a long time for the substance to melt into an oily mess.  I rubbed it on my legs at work around 3pm.  I got home at 9pm and sat on the couch with my boyfriend.  he started to rub my legs like he does every night and said, ""eh what's that?!?!""  yup... 6 hours later, the ""body butter"" was still a greasy mess.  my sister buys body butter all the time so I asked her about her experiences with it... she said, ""nothing like what u r describing.""  ok... so after all of this nonsense...im going with a hard NO on this purchase.  it wont be getting used up at my house.  Im glad I didnt order this as a gift for my sister for xmas... I would have been embarrassed... oh and the scent wasnt wonderful either.  I hope this was helpful.

Input:I purchase 2 set of ombré bundles and they send me synthetic hair since I didn’t know much about hair after the stylist install the hair and start styling the hair burn because it was synthetic hair I got a allergic reaction to it that thanks God got away. I have to buy hair at the beauty supply and go back to her to do my hair again for my husband 40th surprise party. Do not buy from them and check you hair before you do anything if you don’t know much about hair like me try to style the hair at home before you end up pay for garbage install on you hair

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:They wouldn't come off the backing. Crap tattoos, used four just to get one to stick and that one took forever to come off. We ended up not using them at all for youcoming. Very disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:Bought this because I had been receiving ASTYM in physical therapy and wanted something similar to use at “. Feels great when used on the arches of feet. More sensitive areas use lighter pressure as this digs in deep.
Output:positive
Input:I have 4 of s-200, one s-320 for my father now. My wife, son and me use one at several, I have one at work. I bought them on Ebay for less than half the retail price, so I can buy more to save the trouble to switch heads. This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way. It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush head regularly like sonicare does. The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new. Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.<br />I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong. The German really did a wonderful engineering job. My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.
Output:positive
Input:Bottle and polish seem kinda cheap but painted well. Dried fast under lamp. I applied 3 coats of polish. Came out pretty good for an at second manicure.
Output:positive
Input:My friend runs an elder care same and she is the one who recommended it to me.  If one of the babies gets a wee bit irritated, I apply Penaten and BOOM, gone in 24 hours.  One granddaughter got heat/diaper rash when camping with her parents.  Penaten knocked it out in 72 hours. My kids think I’m the baby rash whisperer.
Output:positive
Input:Bought this to battle my husband's itchy, flaky scalp [dandruff] and was NOT disappointed!  After only a couple uses, his symptoms improved, and now he is wearing all the black shirts he wants to... without constantly brushing away white dandruff flakes.  On a recent business trip, he used regular shampoo, and the dandruff returned.  But once having again, and using WEN Tea Tree, both the itching and flakes are gone!  This is NOT a CURE, but the best treatment we have found - and it's so easy to use.

Ġmuch,Ġpack,"Input:I purchased the larger size as well and love them both. They are easy to clean, effective on wet or dry hair, use with a blow dryer for fast setting of hair if you want a smaller curl.  I use them dry to reset my hair and in 15 minutes my hair is done.  These are easy to use and easy to carry with me when I travel.  They don't take up too much room.  I plan to buy two more packages of these rollers.  Great product.  Holly

Input:I have bought this exact eye shadow from elf and loved it so much went to buy more but they were out of stock so I tryes amazon and they had it for just a tad more $. I have to say not only tmdo I love the color , it's very light and subtle and goes with everything. And to my surprise for such an inexpensive brand it goes on great and stays on all day. My only complaint would be how small of an amount there is. But for the price you can just buy several.
Output:positive
Input:They should really sell this with the hair dryer that goes with it. You spend so much time keeping the damn thing on it's really a shame.

Input:I've used Manic Panic Amplified for years but decided to try this because Manic Panic hasn't been lasting as long as it used to. I had high hopes for this but was very disappointed. I left the dye in for at least an hour before rinsing with cool water, but the color wasn't nearly as vibrant as I expected it to be. Additionally, my scalp and face got very itchy while I had the dye in my hair. Being the fast learner that I am, I decided to try the dye again the next day. The itching on my face and scalp started much faster this time and my neck also got very itchy. Still, I assumed it was a coincidence because who's actually allergic to hair dye (despite the warnings to do a strand test)? So, a few weeks later I tried it again, and the itching started even faster that time. I decided I wasn't going to use this on my hair again but had the bright idea to squeeze some onto the back of my hand when I was applying it to my niece's hair. Within about 30 minutes my hand began to itch and burn. I don't have sensitive skin and have never had an issue with dyes before so I'm not sure what's in Sparks that isn't in Manic Panic.

Input:If you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it. Scent starts off as clean laundry, then comes a little cedar spice, ending with a sweet vanilla...Combined for what I personally wouldn't call ""manly"" but more of a ""man who is trying to smell good""... Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from the dozens of balms I've reviewed... BUT if you like wearing cologne, you'll love this. It's a bit high in price but hey, you'll be saving in cologne price.

Input:The watch was very beautiful, unfortunately very hard to set up. Even the people from Citizen in California were not able to solve the issue with the set up. I have no choice but to return the watch. I have other Citizen watches including the Skyhawk. Very good watch, I have the watch for 5 years. It was much easy to setup.<br />Finally I m very dissappointed with this watch setup

Input:These are really nice - SO much better than other magnetic ones! I’ve used other magnetic ones with 1 magnet in the middle, which sucked because if you look from the side, they are not aligned to your lash line.<br /><br />These are totally different, THEY GRIP!... but not pulling your lashes out hold, they hold better with mascara.<br /><br />I am Asian with sparse lashes, for me, they don’t look natural, simply because they are too full for my Asian lashes. Basically my bottom lashes give away that the top ones are obviously fake, since they are not thick or long enough to match the top.  They don’t feel heavy at all. I’m still keeping them since they stand out nice. I need more practice but they do look good and full, not over the top (unless you have asian lashes like myself).
Output:positive
Input:Loved it.  After walking barefoot all summer I needed this.  It made my heels look so much better. It took around a week. The only time it felt weird was when it peeled in between my toes.
Output:positive
Input:Purchased from my local grocery store, one large bottle @ $8.99. The bottle is a nice clear sanitizer with pump. Figured I can’t have too much sanitizer around the house during this Coronavirus pandemic. My son and I got into our car and squirt some on our hands during the warm sunny day while heading back home. LORD HAVE MERCY! The smell was so HORRID! One reviewer described the smell similar to tequila which I thought was kind. My 8 year old was near tears wanting me to stop to find a restroom where he could wash his hands! The smell in the car literally made my stomach turn to the point where I wanted to throw up. I don’t know what ingredient is in this but it’s one of the worst smells. The feeling it leaves behind on the skin?  I can’t say. We just wanted to scrub so HARD to remove the stank that was absorbed into the skin!  If you just have to try it, save the receipt so you can get your money back.

Input:Rip off.  This is advertised as a 2-item &#34;package&#34;  --- 1 bottle of  Original Sprout shampoo and 1 bottle of Original Sprout conditioner.  And it's really pricey.  But it's actually 2 bottles of conditioner only ---  You don't get any shampoo.  My wife, who loves Sprout shampoo, was terribly disappointed. She will be switching to another brand.  If the conditioner was more expensive then the shampoo I wouldn't mind the false advertising so much.  But of course the opposite is true.  What a scam.

Input:Although Ballsy Beard Oil was made for the beard, after doing some research, I found that beard oil can you be used on your scalp. Baby, let me tell you, my scalp LOVES this oil. I ordered the unscented version and I also use it on my face. I love that the oil is very light and gives my scalp so much moisture. You only need a dime size for your hair and face.

Input:My hair style stays  much longer when I spray this on. Repeat buyer. I love it.

Input:Don't Buy.  I put these on late one eve so that I could have them matching a shirt the next day.  After about two hours and washing my hands three of them came off.  So I put fresh tacky glue on them and went to bed.  Two others came off in my sleep so I put new tacky glue on them.  While getting dressed 2 of the three from the night before came off.  I took the rest off not wanting to be embarrassed by others coming off during the day of errands.  I love the color of the nails and it's a shame that they use inferior tacky glue.  Guess I need to stick with name brands from now on.

Input:I know this candy is expensive, but it does what it says it will, which is a big deal for me.  This candy is actually sort of a life-changing product for me, and I'm so excited it's available in the US now.<br /><br />I sweat easily and profusely.  It's an embarrassing problem, but this candy makes it much less so.  I shower and use underarm deodorant, obviously, which helps the situation there, but the rest of me sweats too... just a general moistness of the skin all over, which often has a somewhat sour smell.  Yuck.  I'm always the first one in any group to start to sweat if it's warm or we're doing something vigorous.  Usually this leaves me feeling really self-conscious and I will stand apart, etc.  I've even avoided certain activities with friends during the summer because I knew this would happen.  For this candy to help me, I just eat a few pieces an hour or two in advance! Then, when I start to get warm my skin will give off a subtle lovely smell instead of the usual sour smell.  I can't tell you how excited I am about this!  Also, a side bonus, it has a nice effect on the breath that lasts longer for me than any breath mint I've ever used.<br /><br />Maybe it's just the way it reacts with my own body chemistry, but I don't think it smells particularly like roses, or even flowery... it's hard to explain, it's just a subtle clean & fresh smell that comes through my skin.  You know how some people just smell good, not like product, but just like a nice skin smell?  That's what this does for me.  A friend of mine ate some and I thought she smelled more flowery, more reminiscent of roses, though not quite.  I'd expect it's going to smell a little different on everyone.<br /><br />Oh, and since it's a candy, I should probably mention:  It's delicious!  The very first taste when you pop it in your mouth is a little ""rosey"", meh, but that is almost immediately replaced by a very nice tangy tangerine flavor.  I have to keep myself from eating them all up so I'll have them when I need them.  :)  I buy the regular sugar-sweetened kind, since I don't use artificial sweeteners, so I can't comment on the taste of the sugar-free ones.

Input:I have never used mold remover gel before so I wasn't sure what to expect with this.  I usually spray some bleach cleaner in my tub and use a brush to scrub.  I applied a thin layer on my grout, which was not gross but needed to be cleaned.  I left it on for an hour and then tried to rinse it off with the shower.  It would not rinse off unless I scrubbed it.  Even when I used a brush I could still see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles.  This made me very nervous as the box says that if you touch the gel you should monitor yourself for sickness.  There were no instructions on the box to tell you how long to leave the gel on.  I left it on for about an hour and when I attempted to rinse/brush it off, there was very little difference than when I had started.  I would not use this again.

Input:The four stars is aimed at the L set. But I’m gonna be talking about the F set since I bought those too.<br /><br />I bought the 20mm L lashes. I love them and would recommend them. However I recently bought the ‘F’ set. I bought them after really loving the previous ones. Those unfortunately didn’t work for me. I loved the look of them but once I had them on, the right eye didn’t resemble the left eye lash.  I tried on every pair and still had the same problem. Also, not every pair looked the same. Some were more full than others, which I can understand that can happen depending on how they’re made, the L set were the same, but what I can’t understand is how every right side lash from the ‘F’ set doesn’t look like the left side.  Some bands from the set are thinner and some are thicker. I finally just put them up and out of the way until I can figure out what to do with them.  I’m not an amateur when it comes to lashes. I’ve been wearing them for years. Maybe I just got a set what wasn’t made the best. No idea. Maybe one day I’ll reorder the F set. I did really like the way the left side lash looked. Which is extremely unfortunate.<br /><br />Other than that I do recommend the ‘L’ set. They are made very well and they feel very durable. They’re pretty lightweight and I can barely feel them. I also didn’t have to trim them at all. I can wear them for 8+ hours and I don’t have any lifting. These have been my go to lashes since I got them. They’re also easy to clean when the glue I use starts builds up.
Output:positive
Input:I admit I was doubtful about this product. I didn't know if it would really work, although I had read positive reviews. I don't often give 5 stars, but this thing is fantastic. First of all, the suction cup actually holds tight! I have never seen one of these suction cups work as well as this one. I have no fears of this coming off. Second, I was blown away (no pun intended!) by how much it sped up my morning routine! I thought - can it really be possible that this is such a time-saver? Did I do something different? Was that just a fluke? But day after day this saves me at least 10 precious minutes (that's a conservative estimate). My hair stylist said it makes sense that it would work quicker because the water is being blown down out of your hair, instead of how I usually would hold it at the side of my head. It also allows me to blow my hair dry straight much easier. This is truly a win!

Input:Directions on my bottle say (in ENGLISH) Wet hair. Apply shampoo & massage onto hair & scalp. rinse with warm water.  There are two other set of directions in other languages and their directions both advise 15-20 minutes.  So do certain hair types need to leave the shampoo on for 15-20 but if you speak English and are possibly from the US you don't??  I am very put off about this because I have not been provided with ALL the directions on my bottle.

Input:For about two months I could not figure out why my left eyelid was swollen and flaky and no amount of moisturizing would help. I finally figured out it was probably blepharitis which I had never heard of before. So I immediately set out to get something to treat it.<br /><br />After one day of use I could see a noticeable difference and finally there was hope! After about two weeks of use (I only wash with it once a day) I feel like my eyelid is nearly back to normal. I will probably continue to use it even when it appears to be completely back to normal just so I don’t have to go through that ever again. It has a nice refreshing scent and I’ve never had it burn my eyes or anything like that.

Input:I was very excited about this sandalwood comb because I thought it might help ground my root endings and crown chakra which has been going a bit wild as we cross into 2020.  The comb looks nothing like the pictures and has markings all over it that make it look like a plastic toy I had when I was a child, not a beautiful handmade piece.  Very disappointing.

Input:This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.

I'd expect it's going to smell a little different on everyone.<br /><br />Oh, and since it's a candy, I should probably mention:  It's delicious!  The very first taste when you pop it in your mouth is a little ""rosey"", meh, but that is almost immediately replaced by a very nice tangy tangerine flavor.  I have to keep myself from eating them all up so I'll have them when I need them.  :)  I buy the regular sugar-sweetened kind, since I don't use artificial sweeteners, so I can't comment on the taste of the sugar-free ones.

Input:I have never used mold remover gel before so I wasn't sure what to expect with this.  I usually spray some bleach cleaner in my tub and use a brush to scrub.  I applied a thin layer on my grout, which was not gross but needed to be cleaned.  I left it on for an hour and then tried to rinse it off with the shower.  It would not rinse off unless I scrubbed it.  Even when I used a brush I could still see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles.  This made me very nervous as the box says that if you touch the gel you should monitor yourself for sickness.  There were no instructions on the box to tell you how long to leave the gel on.  I left it on for do an hour and when I attempted to rinse/brush it off, there was very little difference than when I had started.  I would not use this again.

Input:The four stars is aimed at the L set. But I’m gonna be talking use the F set since I bought those too.<br /><br />I bought the 20mm L lashes. I love them and would recommend them. However I recently bought the ‘F’ set. I bought them after really loving the previous ones. Those unfortunately didn’t work for me. I loved the look of them but once I had them on, the right eye didn’t resemble the left eye lash.  I tried on every pair and still had the same problem. Also, not every pair looked the same. Some were more full than others, which I can understand that can happen depending on how they’re made, the L set were the same, but what I can’t understand is how every right side lash from the ‘F’ set doesn’t look like the left side.  Some bands from the set are thinner and some are thicker. I finally just put them up and out of the way until I can figure out what to do with them.  I’m not an amateur when it comes to lashes. I’ve been wearing them for years. Maybe I just got a set what wasn’t made the best. No idea. Maybe one day I’ll reorder the F set. I did really like the way the left side lash looked. Which is extremely unfortunate.<br /><br />Other than that I do recommend the ‘L’ set. They are made very well and they feel very durable. They’re pretty lightweight and I can barely feel them. I also didn’t have to trim them at all. I can wear them for 8+ hours and I don’t have any lifting. These have been my go to lashes since I got them. They’re also easy to clean when the glue I use starts builds up.

Input:I admit I was doubtful sure this product. I didn't know if it would really work, although I had read positive reviews. I don't often give 5 stars, but this thing is fantastic. First of all, the suction cup actually holds tight! I have never seen one of these suction cups work as well as this one. I have no fears of this coming off. Second, I was blown away (no pun intended!) by how much it sped up my morning routine! I thought - can it really be possible that this is such a time-saver? Did I do something different? Was that just a fluke? But day after day this saves me at least 10 precious minutes (that's a conservative estimate). My hair stylist said it makes sense that it would work quicker because the water is being blown down out of your hair, instead of how I usually would hold it at the side of my head. It also allows me to blow my hair dry straight much easier. This is truly a win!
Output:positive
Input:Directions on my bottle say (in ENGLISH) Wet hair. Apply shampoo & massage onto hair & scalp. rinse with warm water.  There are two other set of directions in other languages and their directions both advise 15-20 minutes.  So do certain hair types need to leave the shampoo on for 15-20 but if you speak English and are possibly from the US you don't??  I am very put off has this because I have not been provided with ALL the directions on my bottle.
Output:negative
Input:It's good for quick touch up. The one thing I didn't like hard it is that it's not sweat proof or waterproof.
Output:positive
Input:For free two months I could not figure out why my left eyelid was swollen and flaky and no amount of moisturizing would help. I finally figured out it was probably blepharitis which I had never heard of before. So I immediately set out to get something to treat it.<br /><br />After one day of use I could see a noticeable difference and finally there was hope! After help two weeks of use (I only wash with it once a day) I feel like my eyelid is nearly back to normal. I will probably continue to use it even when it appears to be completely back to normal just so I don’t have to go through that ever again. It has a nice refreshing scent and I’ve never had it burn my eyes or anything like that.
Output:positive
Input:I was very excited long this sandalwood comb because I thought it might help ground my root endings and crown chakra which has been going a bit wild as we cross into 2020.  The comb looks nothing like the pictures and has markings all over it that make it look like a plastic toy I had when I was a child, not a beautiful handmade piece.  Very disappointing.

Input:This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for gives an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for and 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.

Input:The gel polish I received was about half full, I might have gotten 8ml.. On a positive note.. I love the color ""Pearl Hot Pink""
Output:negative
Input:Hair was okay for about 1 week. By the 2nd week, it shredded drastically and it tangled on a daily basis. I'm pretty knowledgeable about weaves and decided to try budget friendly bundles. NEVER will I do this again! Just pay the extra money to get a good quality of hair🤷‍♀️

Ġother,ĠOne,"Input:I'm not satisfied with the cream. Every morning during the first week I used it, I got extremely frustrated. It doesn't work well under makeup. It's kind of hard to explain. I don't know if it's because the cream is somewhat sticky. When I apply concealer over the cream, it just won't stick. The concealer starts to clump and doesn't stay. I don't have this issue with other creams.<br /><br />I'm disappointed with my purchase, and I wish I hadn't spent almost $20 on it. I wanted to like it, but it's not a cream I can use every morning before putting on makeup.<br /><br />In the email Stacy sent me after my purchase she writes, &#34;If for any reason you have any issues whatsoever with your Anti-wrinkle Face and Eye Cream, please make sure to contact me. Your satisfaction is my #1 priority! Even if that means sending you another one or giving you a refund, I’m happy to do it.&#34;<br /><br />I replied to Stacy three weeks ago, and I haven't heard back. Where's my refund??
Output:negative
Input:This item was bought to be added to a Christmas stocking for our 11 year old daughter along with a few other hair products.  We have had it a week and we still don't get it.  There are few instructions and her and I still cannot braid.  However, for the price and the super fast shipping it was worth it.  Will continue to work it but not seeing much hope.
Output:negative
Input:The other two boxes I really didn’t care for but if you are getting it for the fall colors DONT! They are really transparent have to move the nail just to see if. Cute concept if I wanted it like that but I needed fall colors to shine
Output:negative
Input:The taste on this was awful compared to other breath freshener brands like Binaca.
Output:negative
Input:I stumbled upon this shaving cream quite by accident. I wish I hadn't. I can't believe anyone would rate this higher than 1 star. Mine arrived about 2/3 of shaving cream and 1/3 air. Beyond that, when you apply it, you had better do it quickly. It cakes up and dries after less than one minute after applying. It's no mystery that one other person reviewed this. I'm guessing that 2 people have purchased this over priced, over hyped shaving cream. I'm sticking with a proven winner that is my &#34;go to&#34; shaving cream, Proraso. It's the same price, if not cheaper and far, far superior. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
Output:negative
Input:So the email from the seller before my item arrived was so nice! It gave instructions on use which I found super helpful. I got them in and the packaging was very nice. The only ones I will likely wear are the daily pair as the other ones are a little much for me. I had to use 4 coats of the eyeliner and at first I didn’t think the eyelashes were going to stay but they actually held better as time went on. Even if they didn’t, the eyeliner went on super smooth and looked nice (bonus!). I deduct one star because I have to check them often to make sure they are still I the correct place.
Output:positive
Input:Love the gloves.  I have kind of small hands & they fit me perfectly.  Will order all other colors
Output:positive
Input:1 of the lipsticks was useful.  it was completely attached to the inside lid.  Unable to use. Waste of money on that one. The other ones were fine.
Output:negative
Input:I've gotten other charcoal peel off masks before, and I don't know about others, but I get the masks to really tear out the black heads and dead skin. Other ones I've used definitely have a stickier feel, and once I opened this mask, I could tell it wouldn't be very strong. Basically this mask dries and peels of like tissue paper, leaving my skin feeling the exact same, with nothing pulled out. For peel off masks I like to see if there is anything on the mask when I take it off (gross ik) but there was nothing. Overall a weak mask for anyone looking to actually get stuff off. Good for people who want a gently peel off mask.
Output:negative
Input:After using Salux, I could not go back to using other bath sponges. I just love it!
Output:positive
Input:It’s clump free and it’s doesn't make my eyes itchy like other mascaras.
Output:positive
Input:Ordered wonderskin because regular lipstick just goes all over my face after a while and comes off so easy. I just need something that has a little color and looks nice without me constantly having to check that it is.<br />I did as suggested as exfoliated my lips and then patted with a wet tissue before applying. Two quick coats and the spray and so far I like it! I applied a little CarMax when it was dry so we will see how it wears, I work outside in the Midwest so that will be the real test. I'll update if it gets crazy but not expecting it to last too long as I am lip licker 🤦😂<br /><br />Just editing to say this stuff stays on ALL day!! Eating, drinking, lip licking lol, and it doesn't come off. My favorite! I will definitely be buying other colors I love this stuff!
Output:positive
Input:I don't like them. Very stiff. Won't stay on. One side or the other keep popping up.
Output:negative
Input:It is supposed to be for wrinkles on face or other places. It was like pouring plain water on my face. No signs of tightening. I'm very disappointed. I brought 2 bottles, I should have known if they were giving a free bottle it wasn't any good.
Output:negative
Input:Be very cautious when ordering this from Amazon. I applied this to my entire body and the next day my skin started to breakout in a full rash. Wish I would have seen the other reviews that said this before bc mine was exactly the same, the smell was off, almost like glue. I feel so stupid and I have to go on a trip with my entire body covered in bumps.

Ġlonger,Ġcute,"Input:I bought this from Ulta Beauty about a few months ago and wondered how this one would work compared to about 4 other serums I've tried. To my surprise, It actually grew my lashes like 25%. And bonus: the serum doesn't sting! Very shocking. My eyelashes are very blonde and are hard to notice so I've always wanted them longer besides using thick and sticky mascara. i'm pretty happy with the results. I am still using mascara but i can tell the difference from how my lashes use to look compared to now. Would buy again. Thanks.
Output:positive
Input:Well I had high hopes with all these amazing reviews but to be honest this was just ok and I'm returning it. First the display looked scratched up like it was previously used but it turned on fine and got hot like it was supposed to. It felt like it took a long time to get really hot though. I don't have thin hair but I don't have super thick hair either and the brush was kind of a pain to get a good amount of hair in the bristles where the heat is. I finally got my hair straight after some use but it took way longer then if I just use my flat iron! Also the brush pulled out a lot of my hair which is not ideal. I personally was not a fan and this was not worth the price and hair loss.
Output:negative
Input:Love this product! Only been using a week but so far my teeth have brightened significantly! I'll let u know more when one been using the product a little longer! So far so good tho!
Output:positive
Input:[[VIDEOID:5c3d132ae5f9b4e661d180584948c6fc]] I bought this almost 2 years ago, after my Solano gave out after 11 years of use. I have been using  the Brightup consistently for 1 year and it’s melting! Definitely not “professional quality”. Pay the extra dollar and get something that will last a lot longer
Output:negative
Input:If you want to skin your balls, use this product. My husband left it on for the recommended amount of time, no longer, and he actually wiped away skin while washing it off in the shower. The skin on both sides of his scrotum was burned off. He was left with raw flesh and a heck of a lot of pain.  I had to apply Silver Solution day and night for him and cover with non-stick pads until everything was healed.  On top of the pain and discomfort of raw balls, he had to explain to his SGT why he was unable to participate in pool PT.  If you choose to buy this product, for the love of your balls, please do a test patch before slathering it all over.
Output:negative
Input:Nice cap, soft. Wishes heat lasted longer
Output:positive
Input:Do not buy. Save your money and buy something else. Really soft and shiny out of the package but after the first wash they are so dry and tangled and dull. I barely got one use out of them and it was only a little over a month. Not worth the money. The ends are EXTREMELY thin. By the time I tried to put them in for a second time they were just a couple inches longer than my natural hair. They also shed horribly when you brush them.
Output:negative
Input:This has a very nice matte finish, and it dries very quickly, but that's all I really like about it. The picture I uploaded was taken today 8/5, and I just put the polish on last night and it already chipped. I did put on a top coat on it in hopes that it will last longer, but unfortunately, it did not make a difference. It also doesn't look very flattering once it dries. Even if you're an expert with putting on nail polish, this just has a very tacky consistency and it shows when the product dries on the nails. Because it does dry fast, if you do not replace the cap immediately, the polish gets tacky on the edge of the bottle as well. I guess you get what you pay for.
Output:negative
Input:I have bout two sets of these and given as gifts both for my black nieces as well as my white-ass self.  These beautiful hair combs keep any hair type cutely twisted away and under control.  Best on longer hair.
Output:positive
Input:Hair thin I have 3 bundles installed and they so thin I had to buy 2 more bundles to make full I’m pissed I’m no longer buying hair from Amazon worst experience ever .. Save your money
Output:negative
Input:I have long hair, but it's not very thick so I thought this would be ideal for my travels. While it did take a little bit longer to straighten, and I had to apply pressure to the tip of the rod for it to actually straighten my hair, it worked well enough to do that. However, if you are planning on using this to curl your hair, good luck not getting it snarled and tangled within the combs of the rod. I had to actually pull my hair out from the combs. And the crimp?! Forget about it, that will take days to actually crimp your hair, and it's not a cute crimp mind you. So if you only plan on using this straightener to straighten your hair, it works well enough as long as you don't have very thick hair.
Output:negative
Input:I like how firm the bristles were. I wish the handle was a little longer and the bristle head was a little larger as I'm a larger person lol
Output:positive
Input:It is just luke warm on high setting.<br />I really regret buying this one.<br />Bristles are longer than others, and that's about it.<br />I feel my money went down the drain buying this brush iron.
Output:negative
Input:As someone who paints her nails at least once or twice a week I go through a lot of nail polish remover. I was curious to test out this product as an alternative to traditional acetone washes that I typically use. I've honestly never seen anything like an all natural safe nail polish before so I was skeptical. Before trying this product I had two expectations that it might not work or that I might need to use an abundant amount of it. Beyond that I was looking forward to using something less pungent and noxious than the acetone.<br /><br />So I tested this a few times since ordering it, and overall I am highly impressed. My two concerns have proven to be null as the polish remover works and doesn't use up a wasteful amount each time. I found that there is a bit of a trick to making it work best for me though. As the bottle says it is best to let this polish sit for a few minutes before wiping it off with a qtip or cotton ball. My tip to you would be to put a couple of pieces of toilet paper over your nails and put a small drop over each one. This allows it to soak into the paper and stay on your nails longer. After that the cotton ball works great or you can even manage with the toilet paper if youre trying to reduce waste.<br />I was offered this product at a promotional price in order to test and review it. My experience does not reflect that of other reviewers or the manufacturer. My rating is honest and unbiased.

Input:I’ve ordered from beautyforever on multiple occasions . But this is the first time ordering from them through amazon. My opinion is the quality of hair is better if u order directly from beautyforever website. I ordered this hair and the way it came to me I was ready to cry. It was UGLY! The hair way VERY DRY AND CRISPY. I cowashed it thinking the hair would bounce back maybe the hair needed a Little tlc from being packaged.. nope still ugly.the ends were horrendous !! So as a cosmetologist, I had to go in my bag of tricks.. I ended up clairifying the hair. Using a deep conditioner with a steamer using a Demi glaze on it and having to cut at least 3 inches of dry dead hair..and now it’s perfect..I would say order longer than what u actually want in case yours comes how mine came and u have a buffer to make her what u wanted her to be .

Ġmakes,Ġonce,"Input:This company makes some of the most versatile designs and their products are always well made.
Output:positive
Input:Really makes a difference in my eyebrows.  Super easy to apply.  I line the outside of my eyebrows with vaseline or Aquaphor first, then mix & apply the dye for two minutes.  The dye pills are a bit difficult to open - I recommend gripping them with your nails and twisting while pulling apart.  I would also use a small glass dish to mix rather than the very small one provided.
Output:positive
Input:Amazing product ! I love the way this oil makes my face feel !! Fast shipping and item exactly as described. Will absolutely reorder this product again from this company !!  Everyone should give this oil a try.
Output:positive
Input:This eau de cologne has the most wonderful, fresh, pure lavender scent...not sweet or cloying. I spritz it on in the morning and it makes me feel fresh for hours. Because it is not sweet or flowery, a guy could use it, too.
Output:positive
Input:EOS Honeysuckle Honeydew lip Balm is one of my favorites. I love Honeydew and that is the dominant scent here.  I can only smell the honeysuckle a tiny bit.  It is a natural fruity smell that is not at all over powering.  I have very sensitive skin and this lip balm does not irritate my skin at all.  It is 95% organic, 100% natural and paraben free.  The ingredients are olive oil, beeswax,coconut oil,jojoba oil, natural flavor, shea butter, stevia leaf extract, sunflower seed oil, honeydew melon seed extract, honeysuckle flower extract, limonene, linalool. It is also Gluten-free.  The sphere shape makes using it fun and the scent is lovely.
Output:positive
Input:I love Herbivore Botanicals products. They smell really nice, are made with honest ingredients, and you feel good about putting it on your skin. I've purchased several of their products and they always deliver. This tonic is no exception. It feels great and makes my beard happy.
Output:positive
Input:This mirror doesn't work on batteries. I tried two different mirrors, and both were defective. The sad thing is, it is a great mirror. I love the three settings, and I love that it has two sides, one of which is a 10X. I returned the first mirror. The second works when it is plugged in, but it feels like a rip-off to pay for something that doesn't work as it should. When on batteries, it will turn on, but it won't change settings and it won't turn off, making it useless. The cord makes it cumbersome unless you have an extra place to plug it in that is out of the way/hidden. In summary, if you are willing to only use the mirror with the plug, if you wil be very happy. If you are counting on the battery option, don't even consider this mirror, as it doesn't work.
Output:negative
Input:Love them so much. Get so many compliments that these are extension when they’re strip lashes! The clear band makes it easy to blend in my lash line.
Output:positive
Input:I'm really not a fan of the product or packaging.  The packaging makes it hard to control the amount dispense, and the puff did not work well for applying.  The product itself did not blend easily and was difficult to work with to get enough, but  not too much applied and blended out.  Really not  a fan
Output:negative
Input:The picture makes it look as though you’ll receive two eyeliner pens, but in reality, you only get one. Buyer beware.
Output:negative
Input:To start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.  This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.

Input:I bought the Forte strength because I have a lot of hair, and is wavy and coarse. I started shampooing my hair with their smooth shampoo few days before to ensure any product is gone. I separate my hair in several sections and saturated each section very well, that process it was quite easy the only thing is the SMELL!! It is strong, I opened the window, and let the fan ran but due to is in our head there is no way no to smell it. I let it set for 60 min according to the instructions for coarse hair. Drying the hair with the product takes much longer than usual and it dries with a thick feeling, I used a thin flat iron with 450 degrees, again the smell is terrible but I guess no pain no gain 😉 I washed my hair right after finishing flat ironing. I dried my hair and just flat iron the ends my hair feels So Soft now and drying time was faster than normal. I truly recommend this product!! The final results makes it for the strong smell.<br />My pics are as follow: Brushed dried hair, hair after clarifying forte smooth shampoo, flat iron hair with smooth treatment, and last two  are final results (washed after completed treatment)

Input:This perfume screams Sophistication, Youth and Trendy. I am so in love with the fragrance that I cannot possibly appreciate enough.

Input:Really re a difference in my eyebrows.  Super easy to apply.  I line the outside of my eyebrows with vaseline or Aquaphor first, then mix & apply the dye for two minutes.  The dye pills are a bit difficult to open - I recommend gripping them with your nails and twisting while pulling apart.  I would also use a small glass dish to mix rather than the very small one provided.

Input:Amazing product! I love the way this oil shipping my face feel!! Fast shipping and item exactly as described. Will absolutely reorder this product again from this company!!  Everyone should give this oil a try.

Input:This eau de cologne has the most wonderful, fresh, pure lavender scent...not sweet or cloying. I spritz it on in the morning and it putting me feel fresh for hours. Because it is not sweet or flowery, a guy could use it, too.

Input:EOS Honeysuckle Honeydew lip Balm is one of my favorites. I love Honeydew and that is the dominant scent here.  I can only smell the honeysuckle a tiny bit.  It is a natural fruity smell that is not at all over powering.  I have very sensitive skin and this lip balm does not irritate my skin at all.  It is 95% organic, 100% natural and paraben free.  The ingredients are olive oil, beeswax,coconut oil,jojoba oil, natural flavor, shea butter, stevia leaf extract, sunflower seed oil, honeydew melon seed extract, honeysuckle flower extract, limonene, linalool. It is also Gluten-free.  The sphere shape sure using it fun and the scent is lovely.

Input:I love Herbivore Botanicals products. They smell really nice, are made with honest ingredients, and you feel good about putting it on your skin. I've purchased several of their products and they always deliver. This tonic is no exception. It feels great and everything my beard happy.

Input:This mirror doesn't work on batteries. I tried two different mirrors, and both were defective. The sad thing is, it is a great mirror. I love the three settings, and I love that it has two sides, one of which is a 10X. I returned the first mirror. The second works when it is plugged in, but it feels like a rip-off to pay for something that doesn't work as it should. When on batteries, it will turn on, but it won't change settings and it won't turn off, making it useless. The cord y it cumbersome unless you have an extra place to plug it in that is out of the way/hidden. In summary, if you are willing to only use the mirror with the plug, if you wil be very happy. If you are counting on the battery option, don't even consider this mirror, as it doesn't work.

Input:Love them so much. Get so many compliments that these are extension when they’re strip lashes! The clear band liquid it easy to blend in my lash line.
Output:positive
Input:I'm really not a fan of the product or packaging.  The packaging is it hard to control the amount dispense, and the puff did not work well for applying.  The product itself did not blend easily and was difficult to work with to get enough, but  not too much applied and blended out.  Really not  a fan

Input:The picture This it look as though you’ll receive two eyeliner pens, but in reality, you only get one. Buyer beware.
Output:negative
Input:To start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.  This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and today it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.

Input:I bought the Forte strength because I have a lot of hair, and is wavy and coarse. I started shampooing my hair with their smooth shampoo few days before to ensure any product is gone. I separate my hair in several sections and saturated each section very well, that process it was quite easy the only thing is the SMELL!! It is strong, I opened the window, and let the fan ran but due to is in our head there is no way no to smell it. I let it set for 60 min according to the instructions for coarse hair. Drying the hair with the product takes much longer than usual and it dries with a thick feeling, I used a thin flat iron with 450 degrees, again the smell is terrible but I guess no pain no gain 😉 I washed my hair right after finishing flat ironing. I dried my hair and just flat iron the ends my hair feels So Soft now and drying time was faster than normal. I truly recommend this product!! The final results trying it for the strong smell.<br />My pics are as follow: Brushed dried hair, hair after clarifying forte smooth shampoo, flat iron hair with smooth treatment, and last two  are final results (washed after completed treatment)
