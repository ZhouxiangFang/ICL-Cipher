Ġpast,Ġinstructions,"Input:This is a strange one for me. The texture is really grainy when put on. I have to use my fingers to spread it around. Why have a stick if i have to use my fingers anyway? But surprisingly it works for me. I am always amused when people say that deodorant works for them, they just have to reapply it a few times a day.... How is that &#34;works&#34;? I apply this one in the evening after the shower and i am good until the next evening. I really don't like the citrus smell though. I'll keep using this deodorant but will go for a different scent next time.<br />It's worth mentioning that it also stains clothes. From my past experience with other natural deodorants, it seems that if it works, it stains... I have not found a perfect one yet.<br />Update: I tried Bergamot and i like it better, although smell seems to go away as soon as i put it on. The texture is smoother this time but i still need to use my fingures to spread it around.

Input:Unlike Michel Germain products I have purchased in the past, this particular scent was overpoweringly harsh. It honestly smelled like Axe body spray. I would not recommend this product.
Output:negative
Input:I loved this product. I have used it three times over the past 6-8 weeks. I didn’t think it was going to peel, but the fourth day is when I see the best peeling. Being summer time, I know I will need to get more to keep from having crusty feet
Output:positive
Input:All my hair is one length and past my shoulders. This lets me have bangs without the commitment. They are a little shiny but I love them; can’t beat the price.
Output:positive
Input:Although I've owned Norelco shavers in the past, I am very pleased with the smooth, fast, quiet shave given by the 9190XL. With the three settings for sensitivity, I was able to adjust the heads to achieve a shave as close as a blade with absolutely no irritation.  Cleanup is fast and easy by simply flushing the shaver under hot water.  I've used the shaver everyday for the past 3 weeks and haven't had the need to recharge it.  I bought the shaver during the Father's Day sale and saved a lot of money.  This shaver is the best shaver I have ever owned.

Input:I have never purchase air mist from this company. I purchased in past essential oils and those were great , but these essential mists that company makes is a joke. Does not smell at all , it’s super super water dilated ! It doesn’t even smells in a very small tiny room .Not happy with it and I purchased 3 of them :(

Output:negative
Input:I purchased 4 of these as a gift to my mother and grandmother.  I turned them onto Ruby Stone years ago, but they are not able to find them locally anymore.  This set had the buffer added which they didn't need, but wouldn't mind if it was in the package; the real purchase here was the Ruby Stone file itself.<br /><br />The picture shows the Ruby Stone like I expected to receive it - a pullout version like I have used in the past.  It's always been very easy to use and, most importantly easy to handle and gentle.  There are arthritic hands in play here.  Instead the file is some sort of flip out side-sheath with a very point top.  I guess you are supposed to be able to flip it out or pull it out completely (since whenever I flip it it just end up coming out all the way) and then put it back.  I found it hard to get out (the plastic is cheap and curves in to grab the file) and almost impossible to get back in.  There is no way that arthritic hands could handle.  I think the pointy end, combined with the difficulty to manage, only makes this a dangerous combo.  Sure, if someone removes the file for them the first time they can ditch the case but I hate that then there is nothing protecting the stone file from breaking (this version is much thinner than past versions as well, by about half the thickness.  And, not that this makes any difference but is nice to know, it is white vs the original pink).<br /><br />Overall, I am very disappointed.  I tried to return the files but will have to pay shipping even though I was misled.  So now I am stuck with them.  I will scour local stores to find something different for my mother and grandmother.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product unless you cannot find any other ruby stone alternative.  And I hope the image gets updated so others are not misled and left to hold the expense for a product they don't want like I was.

I was so happy to find them here I bought a few packs!<br />Also I don’t use them as hair rubber bands for ponytails my hair is really curly so I shake it out and put this on as if it’s a hairband and then let it fall into a ponytail to hold my curls up in a natural sort of ponytail I suppose but I love them

Input:I recently tried out the Braun Synchro System, thinking it would be great to wake up every morning with a clean, well-oiled shaver.  Although certain areas of my face were easy to cut, I just couldn't get the shaver to  get the short hairs on my chin and neck.  I would spend at least five minutes on those areas alone.  Thinking it was just a face thing and that, eventually my skin would adjust, I carried on past the trial period until well over a month of use.  Finally, I gave up, took the shaver back, and tried the Norelco Quadra.  What a difference!  The Quadra took to my skin immediately and within two days, I was getting almost every hair that the BSS wasn't.  So now I'm a faithful Norelco fan.  Sometimes we fall in love with technology at the expense of the quality of the shave.  I learned my lesson.

Input:This was one of the first LP scents I ever tried after a friend recommended the line to me.  I had grow so tired of ""perfumey"" scents that were too strong and overpowering and never felt like ""me.""  LP Red was at first a total departure than what I was used to in a fragrance.  It comes in a Roll on type of bottle and it's an oil base (they also available in spray form on the website).  It was love at first smell.  I applied sparingly at first as it was spicy and resiny and I didn't want it to be too strong.  It just kept smelling better and better.  It's got a mixture of spicy ingredients: VANILLA, AMBER, PATCHOULI, CINNAMON ,DARK SUGARS ,WOODS, RESINS That work together creating an AMAZING scent.  I've been  loyal LP consumer ever since.  Their whole line is wonderful.  There are tons of scents to choose from and there's a signature scent for everyone.  They will even blend for you.<br /><br />This will just melt right into your skin creating a warm, sexxxxy scent.  If you're looking for something that will have the guys drooling (or if you just want to smell good for you) LP red is a must try.  You won't be sorry.

Input:Aside from the fact that it doesn't strip your skin, leaving precious oils that protect the skin during shaving in place, this has Tea Tree oil which is perfect for penetrating the cuticle and actually 'softening' the hair.

This is the first natural deodorant that I found that works, lasts long, smells good, glides on smooth but not wet, and doesn’t break my underarm out. Turns out many natural deodorants can do that because of the baking soda or coconut oil in them. This one has 4 ingredients and doesn’t break me out in itchy hives. Well done, Magsol!

Ġnew,Ġfull,"Input:I first started using Norelco razors in 1978; my dad gave me one for my fourteenth birthday because, as he told me:  ""Your voice is starting to squeak"".  That first model, a corded one, lasted me for fifteen years before it finally gave out.  I then went through a couple of cordless models whose batteries would get flaky after about four years apiece.<br /><br />Then I decided to invest in the model 6885XL ""Quadra Action"", a $120+ wonder which had a digital readout telling me how many minutes of charge I had left (it was good for about 45 minutes, or two weeks).  Also, I could rinse it out under the tap, which made cleaning it a real breeze.  It would even tell me when to do the cleaning!<br /><br />Alas, after barely two years, the head assembly broke because of a shoddy little plastic nubbin wearing down too much.  This fact is, I believe, relevant to the model I'm reviewing here, as I'll explain in a little bit.<br /><br />Feeling completely betrayed by a company which used to produce such a great product, I decided to try the competition.  Remington makes a rotary razor called the Titanium, so I gave it a whirl.  Unfortunately, after about a year I couldn't take it any more:  it gave me such a progressively worse facial rash that friends started to ask me what was wrong.  Even replacing the blades didn't help!<br /><br />So, about two weeks ago, I broke down and started looking at Norelcos again.  The first thing I ascertained is that the head assemblies in all of the models I examined, be they el-cheapo or mega-expensive, look exactly the same as the one in the 6885XL, meaning that I can reasonably expect them to break in about two years.  Coincidentally, this is the length of the warranty period.  So the expensive razors are out.  After all, if I'm going to buy what is effectively a glorified disposable razor, I might as well not spend a lot of money.  After concluding that I prefer the dual corded/cordless option, the 6843XL, for around $50 on sale, proved to be my best choice.<br /><br />The razor's instructions advise that it could take up to three weeks of exclusive use ""to fully enjoy the closeness of a Norelco shave"".  I can assure you that I was feeling the joy on Day One.  The difference between a Norelco and a Remington is like the difference between Rocky Mountain National Park and the Gobi Desert.  Within a week my skin had almost completely healed.<br /><br />I did notice a few oddities.  As another reviewer also noted, I was quite surprised at how slow the razor seemed to run.  It will be interesting to see if I still get a decently smooth shave in a few months, as the blades start to wear down.  Given how new blades cost almost as much as the razor itself, I would hate to have to buy them more than the recommended once a year.<br /><br />The other disappointment is that the charge is good for only about a week, not two weeks as with my previous razors.  The instructions warn that, although the razor can be used corded, overdoing it will cut down on battery life.  On the other hand, once the batteries are shot, I'll just (hopefully) use the razor as corded full time.<br /><br />The charge indicator doesn't tell you when the batteries are fully charged, but if you let it charge overnight, that should do the trick.<br /><br />Cleaning the razor is straightforward.  You just pop the head assembly off (no hinges on this model), dump out the hairs from the ""hair chamber"", and use the handy little brush to clean things out.  The instructions recommend cleaning the actual head assembly about every two months.  Fair enough.<br /><br />The travel pouch doesn't look too sturdy, but I don't do much traveling.  Plus, I can always use the old pouch from several razors back.<br /><br />Note that, like practically everything else nowadays, the Norelco 6843XL was made in China.  I have terrible misgivings about this, considering how much shoddy merchandise China foists off on us, but it isn't like I have a lot of choice in the matter.  The Remington was also made in China.<br /><br />P.S. My favorite absurd instruction from the manual:  ""When discarding razor, unplug razor ....""<br /><br />Ummm .... yes.  Thanks for that useful tip.  I doubt the cord would stretch all the way to the trash can!

Input:I’m downsizing and lightening up my travel items. My initial impression is that it’s cute and very compact. This brush/comb combo can go anywhere—purse, pocket, car. It doesn’t get crushed or snagged. It pops and “locks” it into a straight position when unfolded and feels reasonably sturdy. It brushed and combed through my thick, slightly textured dry hair nicely. The pastel colors are nice. The price (for a seemingly novelty item) made me hesitate to buy. It sat my Amazon shopping cart for maybe 2 years. However, it’s just what I need for my new toiletry bag, so I’m pleased with my purchase and would buy again.

These pallets are so cute and are able to fit 18 inch rounds in the lager pallet and 9 in the smaller. I messed up and only ordered 1 pan short of being perfect, but still works for me!

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I first started using Norelco razors in 1978; my dad gave me one for my fourteenth birthday because, as he told me:  ""Your voice is starting to squeak"".  That first model, a corded one, lasted me for fifteen years before it finally gave out.  I then went through a couple of cordless models whose batteries would get flaky after about four years apiece.<br /><br />Then I decided to invest in the model 6885XL ""Quadra Action"", a $120+ wonder which had a digital readout telling me how many minutes of charge I had left (it was good for about 45 minutes, or two weeks).  Also, I could rinse it out under the tap, which made cleaning it a real breeze.  It would even tell me when to do the cleaning!<br /><br />Alas, after barely two years, the head assembly broke because of a shoddy little plastic nubbin wearing down too much.  This fact is, I believe, relevant to the model I'm reviewing here, as I'll explain in a little bit.<br /><br />Feeling completely betrayed by a company which used to produce such a great product, I decided to try the competition.  Remington makes a rotary razor called the Titanium, so I gave it a whirl.  Unfortunately, after about a year I couldn't take it any more:  it gave me such a progressively worse facial rash that friends started to ask me what was wrong.  Even replacing the blades didn't help!<br /><br />So, about two weeks ago, I broke down and started looking at Norelcos again.  The first thing I ascertained is that the head assemblies in all of the models I examined, be they el-cheapo or mega-expensive, look exactly the same as the one in the 6885XL, meaning that I can reasonably expect them to break in about two years.  Coincidentally, this is the length of the warranty period.  So the expensive razors are out.  After all, if I'm going to buy what is effectively a glorified disposable razor, I might as well not spend a lot of money.  After concluding that I prefer the dual corded/cordless option, the 6843XL, for around $50 on sale, proved to be my best choice.<br /><br />The razor's instructions advise that it could take up to three weeks of exclusive use ""to fully enjoy the closeness of a Norelco shave"".  I can assure you that I was feeling the joy on Day One.  The difference between a Norelco and a Remington is like the difference between Rocky Mountain National Park and the Gobi Desert.  Within a week my skin had almost completely healed.<br /><br />I did notice a few oddities.  As another reviewer also noted, I was quite surprised at how slow the razor seemed to run.  It will be interesting to see if I still get a decently smooth shave in a few months, as the blades start to wear down.  Given how new blades cost almost as much as the razor itself, I would hate to have to buy them more than the recommended once a year.<br /><br />The other disappointment is that the charge is good for only about a week, not two weeks as with my previous razors.  The instructions warn that, although the razor can be used corded, overdoing it will cut down on battery life.  On the other hand, once the batteries are shot, I'll just (hopefully) use the razor as corded full time.<br /><br />The charge indicator doesn't tell you when the batteries are fully charged, but if you let it charge overnight, that should do the trick.<br /><br />Cleaning the razor is straightforward.  You just pop the head assembly off (no hinges on this model), dump out the hairs from the ""hair chamber"", and use the handy little brush to clean things out.  The instructions recommend cleaning the actual head assembly about every two months.  Fair enough.<br /><br />The travel pouch doesn't look too sturdy, but I don't do much traveling.  Plus, I can always use the old pouch from several razors back.<br /><br />Note that, like practically everything else nowadays, the Norelco 6843XL was made in China.  I have terrible misgivings about this, considering how much shoddy merchandise China foists off on us, but it isn't like I have a lot of choice in the matter.  The Remington was also made in China.<br /><br />P.S. My favorite absurd instruction from the manual:  ""When discarding razor, unplug razor....""<br /><br />Ummm.... yes.  Thanks for that useful tip.  I doubt the cord would stretch all the way to the trash can!

Input:I’m downsizing and lightening up my travel items. My initial impression is that it’s cute and very compact. This brush/comb combo can go anywhere—purse, pocket, car. It doesn’t get crushed or snagged. It pops and “locks” it into a straight position when unfolded and feels reasonably sturdy. It brushed and combed through my thick, slightly textured dry hair nicely. The pastel colors are nice. The price (for a seemingly novelty item) made me hesitate to buy. It sat my Amazon shopping cart for maybe 2 years. However, it’s just what I need for my new toiletry bag, so I’m pleased with my purchase and would buy again.

Input:Best hairspray I've ever used, hands down. I've used other pricey sprays, and Bed Head Hard Head tops all of them by far.  I have long, fine hair that won't hold curl for anything, and this hairspray helps exponentially. A little product goes a LONG way. Personally, I find that the spray does, in fact, make my fine hair a little crunchy once the product dries.  However, I have long hair, so I wait till the spray dries thoroughly and then shake out my hair (or even gently run a brush or pick through it) and break up the crunchy feel.  The curl still holds, but that helps eliminate that helmet head feel. If you have hair that doesn't hold curl or a style, this is the hairspray for you.

Input:The good the bad and the ugly. Here goes. I've always sworn by Norelco trimmers. I've owned several. They normally last reasonably well. I normally get 5 years of use out of them. I say reasonably well because in this day and age, 5 years is good but I prefer things to last 20 years like they used too. Sadly; that's not going to happen. The adjustable guide is the best design that I have found. Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space. The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &#34;turbo&#34; is not only cool but accurate. The charge/low battery lights function well. The vacuum functions well. I've tried other manufactures so called vacuum units and found that not only did they not work they were a total disappointment. This vacuum system works! Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first but you get used to it. The single thing that I miss is the slide up mini trimmer. Frankly; I would rather have that than the vacuum. Still, I like this product and recommend it! I have had it about a year now and it still works perfect!<br /><br />Update: 3 years old and like new!<br /><br />Update: 5 years old, still like new! If it ever fails I'll be buying another Philips/Norelco.

I still cannot use the hair, but I do like that their customer service reached out to attempt to do something to make it right without me even initiating contact with them.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I bought the 22” curly. I understand that 22” means the straightened length, but these are so thin at the ends, that they are maybe 12” at best. The idea was to lengthen and thicken my natural hair, but once I trim this so it doesn’t look like mistreated, broken hair, it’s basically going to be the same length as my own hair. The top looks great, and the curl pattern is nice; but I cannot get beyond how thin and unhealthy it looks. By contrast, I got the same length and curl in another brand because I wanted a different color (one I could dye), and THAT hair looks the length I purchased and healthy all the way through. In the future, I’ll just buy more of the other brand and dye it darker,

Input:I was excited to use this since I thought it would easily remove my gel/dip polish. The videos make it look like it just peels off. Unfortunately, the product arrived with no instructions, improper English on the label, and the stuff was very thick - almost like old nail polish that needs to be thinned. You apparently apply it like nail polish with a brush but it ends up drying and not doing a darned thing. I had no idea how long it needs to be on my nails but I tried leaving it on for 30 minutes before attempting to remove it. My nails were quite literally a mess. I had to wrap them in foil with acetone anyway so I feel like I just spent money for nothing. Good thing it wasn't expensive. I tossed it in the trash.

On top of that, I had to do small amounts of hair at a time. Time consuming, dangerous, and just a waste of money!

Input:I was incredibly excited to get this trimmer. I previously had a Norelco Trimmer that I absolutely loved and thought worked wonderful. After a few years of use the battery didn't hold much charge and I finally lost the charger after traveling!<br /><br />I looked at the trimmers available and the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer sounded great. I was a little worried about purchasing it however because I read some users were having problems with the trimming guard moving position. I thought I'd give it a try and if it didn't work, I'd send it back... and ultimately I was hoping the people having troubles were just incompetent.<br /><br />I charged the trimmer for a day. Played around with the trimming guard by pushing on it and moving it up and down and it seemed to be extremely solid and sturdy. It seemed like it locked in position just fine.<br /><br />After starting to trim on a safe level 6 (my goatie had gotten long, waiting for a new trimmer) I was having success. While gliding the trimmer up the side of my goatie, WHOOPS, it slipped to Level 4. Oh well, I said, I guess I'm going to have a level 4 goatie. Well to sum it up, about halfway into it I was surprised with a slip to level 2.<br /><br />The vacuum is wonderful, it works perfectly. But honestly, do you really give a crap if you have to shave at a level 2 every stinking time? Why didn't I send it back? The package was impossible to open, I had to cut and rip it in shreds. It's hard to go without a trimmer but PLEASE read this review and know that you WILL have problems with it slipping trim guards, I guarantee it.<br /><br />The design of the trim guard dial is part of the problem. I'm not going to sit here and tell Philips how to design a trimmer though, they've done it correctly in the past.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great idea, new innovations work great, but as a trimmer this is a piece of junk because you can't shave at any level higher than a number 2 without risk of ending up 2 levels lower or MORE.

Input:For some reason this line doesn't work for me. I tried the cleanser two years ago and it made my skin break out. After reading the reviews for the moisturizer I decided to give the brand another shot. Bad idea. I looked like I had a sunburn, in addition to breaking out. On the plus side, it did make my skin softer but other moisturizers can do that too. I'm sure this product works well for others but it's not for everyone. Proceed with caution.

Input:So I decided to try the stretching balm for those tough stretches that were starting to hurt as I was moving up in size. From the one stretch that I did and used this daily for healing, it actually seemed to increase the speed on my ear feeling better and looking better. I already had a blowout from stretching once so deciding to use this was a very good idea. I recommend this to anyone gauging their ears.

Output:negative
Input:UPDATE:<br />After my original review, the company contacted me to attempt to make it better. They gave me a partial refund, which I appreciate. I still cannot use the hair, but I do like that their customer service reached out to attempt to do something to make it right without me even initiating contact with them.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I bought the 22” curly. I understand that 22” means the straightened length, but these are so thin at the ends, that they are maybe 12” at best. The idea was to lengthen and thicken my natural hair, but once I trim this so it doesn’t look like mistreated, broken hair, it’s basically going to be the same length as my own hair. The top looks great, and the curl pattern is nice; but I cannot get beyond how thin and unhealthy it looks. By contrast, I got the same length and curl in another brand because I wanted a different color (one I could dye), and THAT hair looks the length I purchased and healthy all the way through. In the future, I’ll just buy more of the other brand and dye it darker,
Output:negative
Input:It's a great idea but needs some improvements. It keeps collapsing while drying my hair making the process impossible! It needs something stiff to keep it from collapsing while in use. Don't waste your money!
Output:negative
Input:I was excited to use this since I thought it would easily remove my gel/dip polish. The videos make it look like it just peels off. Unfortunately, the product arrived with no instructions, improper English on the label, and the stuff was very thick - almost like old nail polish that needs to be thinned. You apparently apply it like nail polish with a brush but it ends up drying and not doing a darned thing. I had no idea how long it needs to be on my nails but I tried leaving it on for 30 minutes before attempting to remove it. My nails were quite literally a mess. I had to wrap them in foil with acetone anyway so I feel like I just spent money for nothing. Good thing it wasn't expensive. I tossed it in the trash.
Output:negative
Input:This product is just awful.  I really regret buying it.  It's so dangerous to use I have no idea why I didn't think about it before.  I think if you get this to use on other people you can get better results, but I tried it, and even with their protection glove I burned myself. On top of that, I had to do small amounts of hair at a time. Time consuming, dangerous, and just a waste of money!
Output:negative
Input:It's not very obvious in the pictures provided, but it's not a seamless piece of silicone. There's a seam around the edges that clings to makeup and leaves streaks. The protruding seams are a bad idea considering one might use this around the eyes as well. I ended up returning this item for a refund.
Output:negative
Input:This product arrived and was not sealed. The product in the bottle was NOT 20% glycol. I have no idea what was inside but it was NOT 20% glycol lotion. I would give 0 stars if that option was available. Returned immediately. Buyer beware, this product is FAKE.

A major plus, considering most products that label themselves as &#34;gentle&#34; often fall short of their claim.<br /><br />I would recommend applying before a shower.

Wore them to my now office job and they were completely acceptable. I clean mine and they can be reused at least 10-12 times per pair if you take care of them. The shape is great because you can trim them down and adjust how far in on the eye they go And can be a full strip of full glam or a half strip to bring up the outer corner fullness for a daytime look. You won’t be disappointed.

Input:If you don't leave it on long enough you end up with stubble.  If you leave it on too long you end up with stubble and chemical burns.  The chemical burns take a few days to heal enough for re-treatment but by then the hair has gotten so much longer you are just going in circles.<br /><br />I guess if you have thin soft hair down there this product may work for you.<br /><br />For me no matter what I did I always had coarse stubble left over.  I remember the last time I had used a hair removal cream it was Veet.  That stuff at least removed most the hair leaving on a few small spots that needed re-treatment.  However the smell was so bad I just can' use that product.  Also I was playing the same game with Veet.  Too long and my skin was in such bad shape I couldn't stand it.  Not long enough and hair was still there.  In the middle I'd get splotchy results.

So far, my hair feels moisturized and soft--and I really love the smell (I tend to be pretty sensitive to the perfumes in body care products--some cause instant headaches).<br /><br />One thing I don't love is the bottle. It's a nice shape aesthetically, but it is not at all easy to get the shampoo out of the pretty bottle (and the thicker conditioner is even worse). Sometimes form has to follow function, NEXXUS!

Input:I was quite excited to give this a go in hopes it would make my feet soft...like baby feet. First off the process itself is nasty, it's like getting a wicked ban sunburn that doesn't stop peeling. My feet were peeling for almost 2 weeks, it was horribly embarrassing at the gym and at work when I usually wear flats and the tops of my feet show. This should be expected given its a foot peel but I guess I didn't expect it to take so long. To put up with having dead skin in all my socks and shoes , not to mention sheets and then get zero results is the real aggravating part. I think my feet are actually in worse shape now, they feel like lizard skin and all the lotion in the world doesn't seem to help. So save yourself the $$, the embarrassment and hopefully your feet and don't buy this.

Input:Hands down my favorite lashes, when I was an MUA these were the main ones I used for all eye shapes for soft glam to full glam. For me they are my go to, great for a day glam or a date night. Wore them to my now office job and they were completely acceptable. I clean mine and they can be reused at least 10-12 times per pair if you take care of them. The shape is great because you can trim them down and adjust how far in on the eye they go And can be a full strip of full glam or a half strip to bring up the outer corner fullness for a daytime look. You won’t be disappointed.

Input:I had been having difficulty finding a face mask that fits because my face is small and my ears are a strange shape for regular face masks. Now I don’t have to worry about my mask not fitting or fitting incorrectly. The headband helps the straps to bypass my ears so that the mask stays in place.

When covered in oil they glide really well, and their shape makes it easy to hold in my hand as I give the massage.<br /><br />There's a guide to giving hot stone massages that is included which is really useful. I was thinking of getting a book, but this has been more than good enough.

Input:If you don't leave it on long enough you end up with stubble.  If you leave it on too long you end up with stubble and chemical burns.  The chemical burns take a few days to heal enough for re-treatment but by then the hair has gotten so much longer you are just going in circles.<br /><br />I guess if you have thin soft hair down there this product may work for you.<br /><br />For me no matter what I did I always had coarse stubble left over.  I remember the last time I had used a hair removal cream it was Veet.  That stuff at least removed most the hair leaving on a few small spots that needed re-treatment.  However the smell was so bad I just can' use that product.  Also I was playing the same game with Veet.  Too long and my skin was in such bad shape I couldn't stand it.  Not long enough and hair was still there.  In the middle I'd get splotchy results.

While you're washing your hair it feel super buttery. Enough to detangle even! But once you rinse you can tell that it's clean but not stripped. I've typically only used Nourish and Shine on my 3B/3C hair for sealing along with the glorious smelling hair serum. A friend actually referred me to this product b/c she claimed it also helped with her perpetual itchy scalp. I didn't dare dream but yes, it helped with that too.  It's definitely worth a shot.

Input:Honestly, it doesn’t really matter to me what this brush looks like, but it is very cute. :)<br /><br />I am a sheltie person, and they get a thick undercoat and shed a lot, mostly seasonally. Did my dog love the brush? Well, she’s pretty particular and doesn’t really like to get brushed so much. But she did cooperate and it wasn’t annoying to her. As the bristle ends are covered in little plastic tips, this is not sharp if it makes contact with the dog or cat’s skin.<br /><br />For me, I love it, It’s very easy to use, fits great in my hand, and the button to clean the fur off it is AMAZING. Just press the button and the fur basically ejects. It also has a good-sized brush head, so it provides wide brushing coverage, and it is very through and goes through tangles well. (Though you should cut any intense tangles first.)<br /><br />You may notice that my review says: Vine Customer Review of Free Product<br />I try not to let that influence my reviews, because I’ve bought a lot of products over the years and I’m very price conscious. I do wonder about the price point of this compared to other similar brushes. This one looks great, feels great, and works great so maybe it is better than those that cost less (I haven’t tested those). But—it’s always best to compare prices and read reviews.<br /><br />For me, I love this; it makes brushing easy, and will replace all my previous dog brushes.

Input:I bought this to trim both my hair and my beard since I keep both the same, very short length. So far, so good. I've had it now for 1.5 years and it's enabled me to keep the exact look I want all the time. It's already saved me money from getting haircuts and since it only takes me me 15-25 minutes to do my head and beard I save a lot of time too. I like the multiple settings....the choices for length are very satisfactory.  My only complaint is that Norelco claims the blades are self sharpening but I've noticed that the trimmer has gotten less efficient over time and that it now takes longer to trim my hair and beard.  Having said that, my needs are fairly unique and this product meets those needs very well.

Input:I want to start out by saying this is the best beard wash I have used (been growing for a little over a year now). I recently tried the beard wash from dollar beard but was not completely stratified. Wild Willies Beard Wash left my beard soft and smelling great. The Teatree cause a nice tingling sensation on the skin which really feels like it's exfoliating the skin and stimulating the hair follicles. This wash does actually alleviate that very annoying itch that one gets on their beard. The smell isn't over powering but actually a very enjoyable fresh clean scent. It truly relaxed my beard hair and made it more manageable with the first application. I will continue using Wild Willies Beard Wash as long as I have my beard!
Output:positive
Input:I saw this at an affordable price and bought two bottles on Prime Day.  I normally use stuff that's a bit more expensive, but I am short on money and don't want to run out of aloe I use for my scalp issues, hair, and skin.  Quality aloe vera gel has a runny, slippery, viscous consistency and blends smoothly into skin and hair before turning a little crunchy -- it is more watery and slippery than sticky, doesn't take long to dry, and gives light hold to hair.  This product has a consistency more like actual synthetic hair gel.  It says it's cold pressed with organic, natural ingredients.  I beg to differ.  This sticky stuff is entirely clear (real aloe gel has a slightly yellowish or greenish tint to it).  This stuff is fragranced but no fragrance is listed on the label or ingredients (false advertising).  I also believe this product contains alcohol.  Real aloe feels soothing when applied to the skin; this stuff stings slightly and does not dry down or integrate into hair fibers (dry hair drinks real aloe right up).  Real aloe vera gel, when applied to hair, helps detangle and provides manageability.  This stuff will make your hair tangle into knots (defeating the purpose of a major reason I bought it).  This product is made in China in Ghuangzou and a rip-off; labelling is deceptive, and the product is not at ALL 100% natural or organic, of the ingredients listed, and not worth your money.  I will use this as a body lotion, but I'll save up to buy myself the high quality stuff again.  Don't you DARE put this on your scalp or skin (if you have seborrheic dermatitis like I do) -- it's full of synthetics, probably alcohol, and phoney.  It will irritate delicate skin and not absorb because it's not natural.

The only thing  that I  don't like is it leaves ruffles  marks on my head when I remove bonnet but that's fine because it goes back the normal within 15 to 20 min.

Input:Doesn't do anything for pulling out any blackheads, but it sure does rip your baby hairs off your face. Go with a different brand if you actually want the product to do what it says it does.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this to trim both my hair and my beard since I keep both the same, very short length. So far, so good. I've had it now for 1.5 years and it's enabled me to keep the exact look I want all the time. It's already saved me money from getting haircuts and since it only takes me me 15-25 minutes to do my head and beard I save a lot of time too. I like the multiple settings....the choices for length are very satisfactory.  My only complaint is that Norelco claims the blades are self sharpening but I've noticed that the trimmer has gotten less efficient over time and that it now takes longer to trim my hair and beard.  Having said that, my needs are fairly unique and this product meets those needs very well.
Output:positive
Input:The magnets were literally falling off before I could put them on. I only go one use it of each pair if you want to call it that.  They didn't even last for a full day. I've been using magnetic lashes for a year and a half now. This was my first and last time with this brand.
Output:negative
Input:I was not happy with they came smaller than I anticipated.  Thought in would use them anyway.  But when they were laundered they curved all up. Its like if you want to use them they would need to be ironed. Which is a huge waste of time in my opinion. Gave them to goodwill.
Output:negative
Input:I can't see why this would get any good reviews.  The pink came out a horrible fright wig pinkish purple neon color.  It was horrid.  It also dyed a patch on the back of my neck which I couldn't get off for 3 weeks. It dyed my roots the awful neon purple color and then the rest was a light putrid purple. It made my hair feel gross and it kept bleeding out even if the slightest amount of moisture hit it. I can see this being good if you just want highlights or streaks, but for the love of all things do not try to dye your whole head.

Input:I want to start out by saying this is the best beard wash I have used (been growing for a little over a year now). I recently tried the beard wash from dollar beard but was not completely stratified. Wild Willies Beard Wash left my beard soft and smelling great. The Teatree cause a nice tingling sensation on the skin which really feels like it's exfoliating the skin and stimulating the hair follicles. This wash does actually alleviate that very annoying itch that one gets on their beard. The smell isn't over powering but actually a very enjoyable fresh clean scent. It truly relaxed my beard hair and made it more manageable with the first application. I will continue using Wild Willies Beard Wash as long as I have my beard!
Output:positive
Input:I saw this at an affordable price and bought two bottles on Prime Day.  I normally use stuff that's a bit more expensive, but I am short on money and don't want to run out of aloe I use for my scalp issues, hair, and skin.  Quality aloe vera gel has a runny, slippery, viscous consistency and blends smoothly into skin and hair before turning a little crunchy -- it is more watery and slippery than sticky, doesn't take long to dry, and gives light hold to hair.  This product has a consistency more like actual synthetic hair gel.  It says it's cold pressed with organic, natural ingredients.  I beg to differ.  This sticky stuff is entirely clear (real aloe gel has a slightly yellowish or greenish tint to it).  This stuff is fragranced but no fragrance is listed on the label or ingredients (false advertising).  I also believe this product contains alcohol.  Real aloe feels soothing when applied to the skin; this stuff stings slightly and does not dry down or integrate into hair fibers (dry hair drinks real aloe right up).  Real aloe vera gel, when applied to hair, helps detangle and provides manageability.  This stuff will make your hair tangle into knots (defeating the purpose of a major reason I bought it).  This product is made in China in Ghuangzou and a rip-off; labelling is deceptive, and the product is not at ALL 100% natural or organic, of the ingredients listed, and not worth your money.  I will use this as a body lotion, but I'll save up to buy myself the high quality stuff again.  Don't you DARE put this on your scalp or skin (if you have seborrheic dermatitis like I do) -- it's full of synthetics, probably alcohol, and phoney.  It will irritate delicate skin and not absorb because it's not natural.

Input:After trying several of the 5 magnet type, I found these and I'm so glad I did!  The 5 magnet type never worked after I tried to cut them to the right size because there was never a magnet on the end, which made it impossible to get them to stay on without using glue. I found these with 10 smaller magnets and thought I would give them a try! I was able to cut them to the right size and still have magnets on both ends, so they would stay on. I am not very good at applying liquid liner, but I was able to get this liner to work just fine. I used these for my wedding and they stayed on all day/evening and weren't too heavy feeling like some lashes. They really made my eyes pop and stand out beautifully in pictures!  In the photos, the close ups were before the wedding to try them out, and although the one end wouldn't stay on that time, I was able to get it to stay on the wedding day.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (which is the same with all of these magnetic liners) is that the liner is difficult to remove. The lashes themselves came off fine, but the liner was not easy to remove (from my skin or the lashes). I don't like to use makeup removers, so I used coconut oil. It took some time to get it off. But I don't think that's anything specific to this liner, it's the magnetic liners in general.<br /><br />I recommend these lashes over all of those 5 magnet ones!

Input:When I received these in the mail, I was pretty mad at how they looked. The rubber's color head bled all over the handle and looked a lil melted, and looked cheap. I needed them badly though cause I'm a cosmetology student and didn't have any brushed for school hat day so I sucked it up and used them. Well looks are definitely deceiving because they are awesome. They have all the sizes I needed, There is a color strip on the brush barrel that changed color when its hot enough. and they are light so your not stressing your hand too much while blow drying.
Output:positive
Input:These have been great! I have thick semi wavy semi curly hair so whenever I want to blow dry my hair I prefer to use a round brush. It makes my hair turn straight but with nice volume at the roots. I like that they come in different sizes.

So far I’m super happy with these brushes.

Input:I was excited to find these. I keep my makeup brushes on my bathroom counter and while I am good about cleaning them, I know they are exposed to a lot of dust and germs, so I was hoping that these covers would be a good solution to keep them nice. I was wrong.<br /><br />Let's start with the three large heads. I was happy to find that these were three different sizes as the main brushes I use have different volumes of bristles. I put them on based on the size of brush and cap. There was no other way to possibly get them onto the brush rather than stick down the heard pull it through until the heart was around the bristles. The silicone was so difficult to slide up my brush handle that I was scared of ripping them and my brush handles are not that thick. Once they were in place I came across my next problem, how to gain access to the brush without fully removing the silicone cover. I somewhat figured out how to use the top hole to flip the cover inside out and expose the bristles, the problem was that in doing so many of the bristles got stuck or were pulled in the wrong direction. I have expensive brushes and I take care of them. I do not want them damaged by a cheap piece of silicone. I tried my best to keep them neat, but after about three days of doing this, the first of the three silicone covers began to rip from this practice. I'm not sure what else I was supposed to do to access my brush. I ended up taking the covers off all three and will maybe use them for traveling, but that's it. They are impractical for day to day use.<br /><br />No to the small ones. These are just annoying. They are all so tiny and all the same size. I have whole bunch of different sized eye shadow brushes and only one or two and the right sized head to fit in these, which makes them mostly useless for me. I don't get the appeal of the suction cup. The pictures show people sticking them to the bathroom mirror, but once the brush is taken out of the cap and the cap remains on the mirror they are going to be impossible to place back in the cover without taking it off the mirror. Additionally the hole to stick the brushes in the caps is so small that the brush bristles were being bent. Again I'm not going to ruin my brushes that cost several times what the covers cost to keep these annoying caps on them.<br /><br />The only reason this set is not getting one star from me is that I can use the large ones when traveling to keep my brushes nice in my makeup bag, but otherwise this set is completely useless.

Absolutely not.

Input:So sounding insane but in all my 41 years on earth I have only used one brush to do my hair an old club style from Fuller. I ordred this cause it is getting old bristles are started to get crunchy and handle has been dropped too many times. Talk about quality tho lasted this long exactly the same but bigger. Super happy with new one I habe fine thin hair works wonderfully. I would say tho if your brushing wet hair get the commander boar can not take water over the years
Output:positive
Input:When I received these in the mail, I was pretty mad at how they looked. The rubber's color head bled all over the handle and looked a lil melted, and looked cheap. I needed them badly though cause I'm a cosmetology student and didn't have any brushed for school hat day so I sucked it up and used them. Well looks are definitely deceiving because they are awesome. They have all the sizes I needed, There is a color strip on the brush barrel that changed color when its hot enough. and they are light so your not stressing your hand too much while blow drying.
Output:positive
Input:These have been great! I have thick semi wavy semi curly hair so whenever I want to blow dry my hair I prefer to use a round brush. It makes my hair turn straight but with nice volume at the roots. I like that they come in different sizes. I use the smaller one around the front of my forehead to grab some of the “baby” hair I have there. They are very durable and handle a good chunk of hair. Definitely not cheap. So far I’m super happy with these brushes.
Output:positive
Input:It has the soft bristles needed for skin use but the handle is flimsy and breaks off at about the 8 week point.  I've used a number of these since I can't find the soft bristles I need, but it breaks off too soon and then the brush is too short to reach your back.  It seems to rust rather quickly, too.

I needed 3 bottles of dye to cover my whole head. Hopefully you can use my photos to compare your hair length to mine and use what I said to help you determine how many bottles you’d need to buy.<br />I didn’t just pour it in my hands and rub it all over my hair, I actually sectioned out my hair piece by piece to make sure I got the dye on every last bit of hair as evenly as possible. This whole process took about 2 hours. Yes, it was exactly as awful as it sounds. Man were my arms tired.. After I finished dying it, I put all of my hair up in a shower cap / bonnet and let it sit for 5 whole hours. Excessive?

Well I was in the shower for a good 40 minutes shampooing the life outta my hair before I just gave up and got out the shower lol. My shower water continued to run pink every time I washed my hair for at least a good 2 to 3 weeks.<br />Oh and as for the washing?? Yeah I hate cold water so I never did any of that stuff that you’re supposed to do. I continued to shower every to every other day, and I used warm to hot water every time. Yeah yeah I know the color won’t last as long, but screw a cold shower. I also switched to using Herbal Essences Color Me Happy shampoo.<br />[EDIT: I am now aware that Color Me Happy is actually horrible for colored hair.

Input:Update about a month after my initial review:<br /><br />At first, i was disappointed that it didn't do much for my hair loss. Well, it is month two (and a half) and this shampoo is definitely getting some baby hair growing. The volume effect is only getting better week by week. I can say with confidence that the more i use the shampoo the bette the results. I'm getting another bottle now!<br /><br />The only question remaining is: will my hair shed slow past two month mark of using this product.<br />I will update again in a month.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />first review:<br /><br />My specific need for this shampoo was try to help with extreme stress induced hair shed. The brand promises to ""stimulate keratinocytes for renewed hair growth"", and there were some anecdotal reports of it helping with hair loss I found in my research, so I gave it a try. I've been using it for a little over a month now, twice a week, and cannot definitely see any difference it might be making in my hair regrowth. It didn't prevent any further hair shedding though. My hair keeps falling out at about the same rate it did.<br /><br />The positive is that the shampoo didn't seem to do any further damage either. It does produce a thickened look. My hair is naturally fine and even in its best days i could hardly get any volume at the root. This seems to be helping with the texture and fuller appearance. I would not call the effect ""silky"", as the thickening effect is achieved by making the hair coarser than my natural state. This means i have to be extra diligent with my conditioner to aid smoother results along the entire length.  Oh, and it also tangles quite a bit in the shower.<br /><br />All in all, I think my search for hair regrowth solution continues.

Input:I love these!! I recently ordered some other similar silicone bottles and was just as happy with those! They are actually very similar which is why I am again happy! This comes in a nice little blue drawstring bag, and includes 3 of the silicone bottles in Blue, Green and Pink. They have textured edges which is great to avoid dropping the bottle while using it in the shower. And also doubles as a make up brush cleaner, where you see the little dots on the top edge of the bottle. It's easily washable!!<br /><br />The caps snap open and have a silicone opening, with a little slit, allowing you to squeeze out your product and it does not allow air back into the bottle. This means that you can always get every last drop because these are so flexible, you can bend them in every direction and they will go back to their original shape! I am taking a trip across country in a couple of weeks, and these are PERFECT! I will never buy those cheap plastic bottles at the store again. They are crap! As all Amazon customers are freely given the opportunity to test out products for review, I purchased these silicone bottles at half of the price and promised to give my feedback to the company and to other potential customers, just like me, and give my true experience with the item(s). I am not paid to write my reviews nor am I required/coerced/bribed to give a positive rating. Reviews which include this disclaimer, are not fake.

Input:This bath brush is wonderful! The first thing I did upon removing it from its package is scratch my back. The handle is nice and long and able to reach all the spots on my back with no effort. I have an old shoulder injury and was able to use it without difficulty. At first, I could not figure out how to detach the brush from the handle because the wood is solid - no cheap, easily-splintered junk here. My daughter then placed her hand inside the strap and slid the brush right off! Again, the strap is nice and secure and doesn't show any signs of falling off anytime soon.<br /><br />Let's talk bristles. I've bought brushes before where the bristles fall right out, or they're plastic and hard. These are nice and soft. During its inaugural use, I did see one or two hairs fall out, but nothing after that. I'm thinking that's probably a normal occurrence and it doesn't affect the brush in any way.<br /><br />I received this brush at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Would I buy it at non-discount? Yes!

Input:I purchased the caffeinated lip balm called “Beach Ballistic” sunny pineapple and creamy coconut. I love Posh products and was excited to find some discontinued products I had never seen before. I can see why this one went into the retired line. There is virtually no fragrance at all. Posh is kinda known for their great fragrances. It is a great lip balm but it doesn’t smell or taste good at all. Perfectly Posh you were correct in dropping this product.

Input:Update about a month after my initial review:<br /><br />At first, i was disappointed that it didn't do much for my hair loss. Well, it is month two (and a half) and this shampoo is definitely getting some baby hair growing. The volume effect is only getting better week by week. I can say with confidence that the more i use the shampoo the bette the results. I'm getting another bottle now!<br /><br />The only question remaining is: will my hair shed slow past two month mark of using this product.<br />I will update again in a month.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />first review:<br /><br />My specific need for this shampoo was try to help with extreme stress induced hair shed. The brand promises to ""stimulate keratinocytes for renewed hair growth"", and there were some anecdotal reports of it helping with hair loss I found in my research, so I gave it a try. I've been using it for a little over a month now, twice a week, and cannot definitely see any difference it might be making in my hair regrowth. It didn't prevent any further hair shedding though. My hair keeps falling out at about the same rate it did.<br /><br />The positive is that the shampoo didn't seem to do any further damage either. It does produce a thickened look. My hair is naturally fine and even in its best days i could hardly get any volume at the root. This seems to be helping with the texture and fuller appearance. I would not call the effect ""silky"", as the thickening effect is achieved by making the hair coarser than my natural state. This means i have to be extra diligent with my conditioner to aid smoother results along the entire length.  Oh, and it also tangles quite a bit in the shower.<br /><br />All in all, I think my search for hair regrowth solution continues.

Input:It does stay on hand but it's too tight. The velcro doesn't stick to all items, so watch that. It would not stick to my phone. Asked to return...didn't care for customer service. Item must be new and unused to return. So basically you can spend your money and look at it but you don't get to see if it fits your hand/phone. So I am not able to return or exchange. But this is my fault for not reading their return policy. My bad :(  To sum up, item is ok depending upon what you put it on but customer is not ok :(

Input:I love these!! I recently ordered some other similar silicone bottles and was just as happy with those! They are actually very similar which is why I am again happy! This comes in a nice little blue drawstring bag, and includes 3 of the silicone bottles in Blue, Green and Pink. They have textured edges which is great to avoid dropping the bottle while using it in the shower. And also doubles as a make up brush cleaner, where you see the little dots on the top edge of the bottle. It's easily washable!!<br /><br />The caps snap open and have a silicone opening, with a little slit, allowing you to squeeze out your product and it does not allow air back into the bottle. This means that you can always get every last drop because these are so flexible, you can bend them in every direction and they will go back to their original shape! I am taking a trip across country in a couple of weeks, and these are PERFECT! I will never buy those cheap plastic bottles at the store again. They are crap! As all Amazon customers are freely given the opportunity to test out products for review, I purchased these silicone bottles at half of the price and promised to give my feedback to the company and to other potential customers, just like me, and give my true experience with the item(s). I am not paid to write my reviews nor am I required/coerced/bribed to give a positive rating. Reviews which include this disclaimer, are not fake. It states in Amazon's terms of service, that we must be honest and forthcoming if we purchase a product discounted, so it simply shows that we are genuine Amazon customers, just like you, who are sure to be completely honest and follow the rules.

Input:I don't have enough hair to need a hair pick.  I read a tip that said these work great as a gizmo to hold vegetables while slicing.  The tip is correct, these are a fantastic kitchen tool.

The tines are stainless steel so they won't rust and are easy to clean.

Input:Overall, I would definitely not recommend this product until major changes have been made. There's definitely a market segment where there is a dire need for a product that can clean pet feet after a wet and dirty walk outside. I have two dogs and live in an area that is muddy and rainy all the time which results in super dirty patios and walkways when we get in the house. When I first saw this product i was actually very interested in first but upon using I was disappointed. The spin speed is in no way strong enough to get rid of dirt and gunk buildup between the dogs feet and just using the dog paw washer is incredibly messy with water spilling out all over the place. Honestly, after trying my best to use this product a few times i'd rather just carry my dogs into the bath tub and cleaning their paws myself.

It went on easy, with just our fingers, and we left it on for about 45 minutes. It actually probably should have been peeled off after 20-30 minutes, because it was fairly hardened by the time we took it off. It still came off nicely, just in smaller chunks. You could see all the dirt from your pores on the pieces! My face felt clean and soft afterwards, and I followed up with a maracuja oil to lock it in. My skin is slightly red, but that's normal for me after just about any mask or treatment, and could easily be covered by makeup if necessary (but I did it at night, so I'm sure the redness will be gone by morning). I'm looking forward to trying another one, and it's definitely a great value for your money!

After a week of using this i really like it. Its def different for me since ive used rags all my life lol. For me, im only gonna use this every other day simply because im not really use to the “exfoliated” softness and using this everyday i feel takes away that ‘Oooo’ moment of feeling a difference on my skin😂 I def love and can feel the difference using this after shaving, Oh my goodness like the itching just completely stops and ingrown hairs are nonexistent which i absolutely LOVE. I really wonder how nylon can do such a magical thing😂😂🤔 This thing suds up VERY well. When i hand washed it the very first time & let it soak in detergent, it wasnt really as much dye as i expected to bleed from it. After maybe the first several uses, i noticed only slight dye when i hung it to dry but nothing major. It stopped after a weeks use so the dye really wasnt a problem, especially with it being hot pink. Overall, I really enjoy using this cloth☺️ Great purchase!

The only cons that I have noticed is that it does not detangle as well and my hair does not feel quite as soft.  That being said it looks better, healthier, and shinier using these.

Output:negative
Input:I paid a discounted price for this product in order to review it on Amazon. I'm being very honest in my review, and I tend to be very critical about products. Here is what I thought about it:<br /><br />I really liked this bag. The first thing I noticed that was different from other cosmetic bags was it's size and shape-I liked it! Usually cosmetic bags are long and awkward but I loved the little compact square simple shape of this one. I feel like with the longer ones all your stuff gets mixed together and ends up a mess so this seemed like the perfect size. It fit a surprisingly lot of cosmetics in there. I actually thought there were a lot of seemingly minor but really nice features on this little bag. Here are some of the features that, while small, felt like they really made a difference:<br /><br />1) I LOVE the little mesh on the each side of the bag. Instead of being one massive empty container, the mesh helped me separate some products from others. For example, I have a little tub of cream that always gets lost in my regular cosmetic bag. I'm sure you have all been through it--where you are digging and digging just to find something small sunken down at the bottom of your bag. Here, I simply stuck it on the side and could easily grab it. Same with thin pencil liners--they are impossible to find in other bags but here I stuck mine in the mesh and presto! I could grab them easily. I also kept a pack of mini tissues in the mesh so that they wouldn't touch my make up which on occasion will leak.<br /><br />2) I love that the zipper had a large tag-like thing at the end so you could easily grab it. My other bags end up getting weighed down by make-up and then it's hard to get a good grip on the dinky little zippers that other bags include. Plus, this one seems like it is not going to fall off easily.<br /><br />3) The zipper seems very solid and smooth. I hate when bags are nice and then the zipper is cheap. Not so here.<br /><br />4) The size is awesome and perfect for me--as I mentioned above. I love the cute boxy shape.<br /><br />5) The logo (and zipper hold, mentioned above) seem solidly sewn in, not cheaply and loosely attached like other bags I have bought.<br /><br />The only thing that I feel could have been an improvement are: I would have loved for the strap to be a velcro strap so it could hook onto other bags or items easily. And I'm not in love with the colors of the logo. But neither of these are a big deal and by far, the functionality of the bag outweighed these desired improvements.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a simple, functional cosmetic bag that holds a decent amount of stuff, this will be fine for you! I hope my description is helpful! I thought this product was really cute.<br /><br />I posted some pictures below to give you a sense of the size and about how much can fit in the bag (I could fit more cosmetics but I wanted you to see the cool mesh on the sides so I didn't pack it to the gills. I also included a picture of the zipper.<br />Thanks for reading! (:

Input:I had high hopes for these as I have had pretty good luck with ither heatless curling items. Sadly these were not one of them. The set is nice as it comes with 2 of them. One is a microfiber and one is a satiny material. They each have 2 scrunched made of the same material. It also has one claw clip and one gator barrette with a plastic carrying bag. I started with about 60% wet, clean hair. I did spray texture spray and use Beachwavers braid balm before wrapping my hair around each side. I had my hair in it for a total of 8.5hrs. I kept them in overnight and all morning while getting ready. I sprayed my hair with hair sprayed and removed it. Once I took them out a majority of my hair was still damp. I tried to scrunched it and do what u could to save some kind of waves. As you can see in the 2nd picture that it really did nothing at all. It was also not the most comfortable thing to sleep in but is doable. Overall I would pick other heatless curling methods over this set. It could be fun to do at sleepovers or for other types of hair but it just did not work for me at all.

Input:Firstly the picture is misleading it shows 3 hair removal brushes, yet its only 1 you receive.  The wire that makes up the brush is all bundles up, didn't even look like a brush upon receipt.  You have to manually rearrange the metal brushes.

Input:Product shredded,leght of the hair was off by a few inches color was off and the hair texture was super thin...not as pictured and the style of the hair was not what it appeared to hbe there is a blend of human hair and synthetic and also the hair is not ombre highlight like the picture....its more just different colors throughout the hair...I'm so disappointed I brought this for 200 and didn't get what was pictured

Input:I paid a discounted price for this product in order to review it on Amazon. I'm being very honest in my review, and I tend to be very critical about products. Here is what I thought about it:<br /><br />I really liked this bag. The first thing I noticed that was different from other cosmetic bags was it's size and shape-I liked it! Usually cosmetic bags are long and awkward but I loved the little compact square simple shape of this one. I feel like with the longer ones all your stuff gets mixed together and ends up a mess so this seemed like the perfect size. It fit a surprisingly lot of cosmetics in there. I actually thought there were a lot of seemingly minor but really nice features on this little bag. Here are some of the features that, while small, felt like they really made a difference:<br /><br />1) I LOVE the little mesh on the each side of the bag. Instead of being one massive empty container, the mesh helped me separate some products from others. For example, I have a little tub of cream that always gets lost in my regular cosmetic bag. I'm sure you have all been through it--where you are digging and digging just to find something small sunken down at the bottom of your bag. Here, I simply stuck it on the side and could easily grab it. Same with thin pencil liners--they are impossible to find in other bags but here I stuck mine in the mesh and presto! I could grab them easily. I also kept a pack of mini tissues in the mesh so that they wouldn't touch my make up which on occasion will leak.<br /><br />2) I love that the zipper had a large tag-like thing at the end so you could easily grab it. My other bags end up getting weighed down by make-up and then it's hard to get a good grip on the dinky little zippers that other bags include. Plus, this one seems like it is not going to fall off easily.<br /><br />3) The zipper seems very solid and smooth. I hate when bags are nice and then the zipper is cheap. Not so here.<br /><br />4) The size is awesome and perfect for me--as I mentioned above. I love the cute boxy shape.<br /><br />5) The logo (and zipper hold, mentioned above) seem solidly sewn in, not cheaply and loosely attached like other bags I have bought.<br /><br />The only thing that I feel could have been an improvement are: I would have loved for the strap to be a velcro strap so it could hook onto other bags or items easily. And I'm not in love with the colors of the logo. But neither of these are a big deal and by far, the functionality of the bag outweighed these desired improvements.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a simple, functional cosmetic bag that holds a decent amount of stuff, this will be fine for you! I hope my description is helpful! I thought this product was really cute.<br /><br />I posted some pictures below to give you a sense of the size and about how much can fit in the bag (I could fit more cosmetics but I wanted you to see the cool mesh on the sides so I didn't pack it to the gills. I also included a picture of the zipper.<br />Thanks for reading! (:

Input:I had high hopes for these as I have had pretty good luck with ither heatless curling items. Sadly these were not one of them. The set is nice as it comes with 2 of them. One is a microfiber and one is a satiny material. They each have 2 scrunched made of the same material. It also has one claw clip and one gator barrette with a plastic carrying bag. I started with about 60% wet, clean hair. I did spray texture spray and use Beachwavers braid balm before wrapping my hair around each side. I had my hair in it for a total of 8.5hrs. I kept them in overnight and all morning while getting ready. I sprayed my hair with hair sprayed and removed it. Once I took them out a majority of my hair was still damp. I tried to scrunched it and do what u could to save some kind of waves. As you can see in the 2nd picture that it really did nothing at all. It was also not the most comfortable thing to sleep in but is doable. Overall I would pick other heatless curling methods over this set. It could be fun to do at sleepovers or for other types of hair but it just did not work for me at all.

It does not prevent odor (it's one and only job), and has the added awfulness of mixing with body odor to create an even funkier smell. On top of that, the pump has basically stopped working and the bottle is more than half full, so now I have to unscrew the cap or risk the pump spraying EVERYWHERE. Add on the hefty price tag and this just isn't worth it. One star because it's a lotion and not a paste or gel (I guess).

Input:I haven't had a hair cut in over 2 years. Its kind of crazy, but between going through IVF treatments, a pregnancy that we were on pins and needles about, and then COVID hitting, I haven't had my hair colored or been inside of a salon since January 2019. Now that I have a 13 month old, finding time by myself to go is nearly impossible.<br /><br />With that said, my hair is crazy long and healthy. But going through postpartum, I ended up with some hair loss that is now in the process of growing back. I used to love getting Keratin treatments in the salon because it always made my hair feel so good, look super shiny and healthy, and just overall made me feel good. I was anxious to try this at home Keratin system to see if I could get similar results, and much to my surprise, I did! Not only is it easy to do, but my hair looks, and feels so much healthier! It really did wonders on smoothing out some of the frizzy dead ends that need trimmed, and created a sort of gloss look overtop my hair. It brightened up my naturally dark ashy hair color, and was just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone with long hair looking to revitalize your long locks!

I mean all those videos showed the same thing, they spread the green stuff on a persons face had to be real, right?????<br /><br />Wrong!!! They show someone with a face full of blackheads getting this product smeared all over their face then  when it is gently wiped it off and the cloth is turned over to reveal the results it shows hundreds of black heads that were miraculously wiped off.<br /><br />Well, there were no instructions in English so I winged it.  I spread it over my face expectantly knowing my face would look amazing as soon as I wiped it off again.  It smelled nice, I will say that.  I let it dry as it seemed to be a clay mask and then wet a cloth to remove it.<br /><br />Would you believe not a single black head appeared on my cloth?  Not ONE!<br /><br />But here is the best part, in a couple days, not only did I still have the few black heads that were still smugly laughing at me from their cozy nests in my pores, but all of their friends and relations showed up for a party on my face.  I have not had a break out like this in years.<br /><br />Just like the good old days, only there are no lockers that I have to worry about being shoved into by the popular kids.

After using this oil, the pad is perfectly clean, not a trace of the makeup I removed.  Other products were not this thorough.  I am still not convinced I am getting more than a bottle of olive oil, but I am very pleased with the performance of this product.

Ġline,ĠYou,"Input:This is an extremely well-made unit and appears completely waterproof.  It charges in about an hour with a charge that lasts me four showers.  While it removes some skin I would prefer stiffer rubber “bristles.”  The handle is made of a slippery plastic that is impossible to hang into with soapy hands.  Probably OK for the bathtub, but risky in the shower.  Men usually have larger backs and are less flexible.  So I made a longer “handle” with a 12” PVC pipe, attached with a gasket and a hose clamp, easily removed for charging.  The pipe also doesn’t slip in a soapy hand.  With all the running gear in the head the unit is top heavy when in the charger.  Even the suction cups on the charger base can’t hold it upright.  However, the gasket for the handle also pushes the unit enough off center to balance it and prevent fall overs.  The instruction sheet is a riot.  It reads like it was run from Chinese through a translation program into “English.”  The best line is “Especially designed with horny brush and thus removing residual horniness.”  If only it were so simple!  It should be rewritten by a native English speaker.

Input:I love this sunscreen. It's perfect for those who need a little bit of color any time of the year. Even if you are pale, have no fear - even when you spread it on it will absorb into your skin and give you the right amount of color.<br /><br /> It also seems to even out my reddish skin. I could see myself using this a lot in the summer. This has been my favorite product from this line!
Output:positive
Input:I have tried most razors on the market from older dual edge, single blade razors to the new three blade disposable razors (I have not tried any of the new quad-configuration razors, however.) Of all the razors I have tried, my overall favorite is the Gillette Sensor Excel. The combination of shaving closeness and relatively long blade life make this razor a good choice for most people.<br /><br />The bottom line is that these blades provide an optimum, smooth shave and last a long time, which is why I continue to use them despite the relatively high cost. The most economical way to buy these blades is in the 15-cartridge pack; so if you like the Sensor Excel like I do, this package is the best value you will find. I give the Sensor Excel five stars for technical merit, even though the replacement blades are quite expensive.

Input:I upgraded from a Norelco 6865XL that I've had for about 5 years or so, and the 9160XL makes a world of difference. There are minor improvements - I like the color, it seems to clean easier, and the battery lasts a LOT longer. I haven't re-charged it yet after three weeks of continuous use, and I have half a battery left. But the vastly superior feature to the 9160 is clearly the increased size of the shaving surface. Instead of one ring of cutters per head, there are now three, leaving virtually no open space on the razor head to miss your face. For me, I would say shaving now takes - coincidentally - 1/3rd as long and I get a much better shave for it.<br /><br />Other nice additions I like are the more intelligent placement of the ""small"" holes for the cutters. On the 6865 the large openings were on the outside and the small openings were on the inside of the razor, but on the 9160 the small openings are dispersed across the razor head in a more sensible manner. Also, there is a sensitivity dial that may prove useful to some people, especially on the neck.<br /><br />As for downsides, there are two: I don't think this razor is significantly better at shaving the neck than my previous one, although the increased shaving area helps out. I think few electrics do a stellar job in this area so it came as no surprise. More importantly, the new ""rocking head"" mechanism on the SmartTouch series seems to be pointless. Perhaps it's helping and I can't tell, but when I pay attention to it, it doesn't seem to move hardly at all, and not in any way that gives the appearance of being useful. Since the major bonus on this razor - the 3 rows of cutting heads - is available on the SpeedXL line, one might be better off with just getting that model.<br /><br />Word of warning: some of the other reviews complain that this isn't better than a traditional non-electric razor. Probably not, few electrics are. It takes quite a bit of time to get used to an electric, but it's worth the patience.

Input:The instructions are easy -- pump out a small amount on your hands and rub all over your face. Rinse off with warm water. I found that it works well. I do wear foundation, concealer, eye shadow, brow pencil and mascara. It removed everything effectively. It's kind of like an oil but not as heavy. It left my face feeling nice. I have a night routine of skin care, and this is just the first step.<br /><br />Bottom line if the price doesn't bother you, go for it. I for one have another product I like just as well that is a third of what this costs. I was provided a sample of this through Amazon Vine's reviewer program. All comments and opinions are honest and unbiased.

Input:I am a senior citizen and so I do not have the youthful eyes and long lashes I had back in my youth. I have tried numerous mascaras throughout the years including the expensive lines. I even got some of those magnetic eyelashes and gave them a try but I could not apply the eyeliner in a straight line and ended up looking like somewhat of a side shoe.<br /><br />This mascara is miraculous! I can apply it and immediately see the difference in my lashes. Not only do I see added length and thickness, but it gives my eyes depth. I can't believe this product is of such high quality and it is affordable.<br /><br />Thanks for giving my old tired eyes a coat of youthfulness!

Input:I applaud this brand for offering great products without plastic packaging. I've been trying to reduce my personal contribution to our world's plastic problem, so I decided to try the Ethique shampoos. After I was satisfied with the frizz wrangler shampoo bar, I checked out the other products made by Ethique. I was SUPER STOKED to see that they had a deodorant option, as I have previously tried to find a deodorant without aluminum and other strong chemicals. After trying a few options I gave up and, honestly, just stopped wearing deodorant except for during special occasions. I know that might sound gross, but it felt like the better option to me. Anyway, since I was so pleased with the shampoo, I tried this deodorant. I am very pleased with the spearmint & lime deodorant! I have seen other reviews mention condensation on the bar and I have noticed that as well. However,  it doesn't seem to affect the functionality at all, so I don't understand why people complain about it. I do think it's important to apply this deodorant right after you dry off from the shower as it's a much easier task when your skin isn't bone dry. I will say that I also bought the lavender & vanilla option, but I couldn't even try it because I found the smell to be intolerable (and, incidentally, lacking any hint of vanilla). It wasn't that the smell was too strong, it was just incredibly unappealing to me.<br /><br />In summary, I'm very happy with the spearmint & lime deodorant. I think it even has some antiperspirant properties, which was an unexpected, but awesome surprise. I'm definitely going to keep trying the Ethique product line. I'm going to give the dog shampoo a try next.

Input:Edit: From 3 Stars to 1 Star-  It was hard trying to put on the lashes, but the tweezers are so long I touched my eye by accident again LUCKILY NOT POKING ME. But..... so again with these tweezers!!! My finger (while putting on lashes) touched the top of it and it punctured me making me bleed! So no I do not reccomend these at all until they fix these knife tweezers! Also it doesn't curve with my eye nicely so one part of it looked ok while the other part was sticking up with an unnatural look.<br />Old: So these are the first false lashes I have ever bought. Tried putting them on multiple times and they kept slipping before putting the anchor lashes on and would not wiggle closer to my lash line after the anchors were on. I didn't stab myself in the eye, which is good because these tweezers are KNIFE POINT SHARP!! Taking them off is complicated but not the worst. 3 Star because they're are difficult yet they look nice.
Output:negative
Input:Everything was wonderfully packaged and the lashes look like a mid range quality. It was my first time using magnetic lashes so I wasnt sure what to expect as far as the magnets go. Each lash as four small magnetic strips evenly spaced along the lash line. I applied the liner directly on to my eye as I normally would. Liquid liner glides on beautifully with no skipping or streaking. I placed the first lash on and it seemed to stick with no issues. Placed the second lash and it was having issues sticking on the corner. I attempted to apply more liner and restick while wet. It stuck for a few minutes before popping off again. I ended reapplying two more times, but after an hour it came off again and I removed the lashes for the night. They come off almost too easily. I chalked it up to oily skin and sweat.<br /><br />Attempt two was tragic. The whole reason to buy magnetic lashes is the reusablity of them. Despite tweezers, magnifying mirror and years of applying lashes experience these little suckers would not stick. Luckily I i was able to use some lash glue and where them traditionally.

Input:This is a good tool, especially for the price.<br />As I was using it, one line of brush &#34;teeth&#34; flew out.<br />I noticed that as I turned the insulated black knob at the end, there was a wider than usual slot.  I turned the knob to line up that slot with the slot on the barrel where the line of teeth should go.  The line of teeth slipped in easily.

Input:This is NOT Manic Panic's amplified color. I am an avid Manic Panic fan, and was quite disappointed to receive their usual cream color (still decent, but Manic Panic's Amplified line last 2 to 3 times longer). As I paid for, AND ORDERED, the Amplified color, I am dissatisfied. It had also been an extreme inconvenience for me, as I needed this immediately, as my hair is now faded to a gross orange/ blonde color, and I now need to wait extra weeks due to contacting the seller and waiting for a replacement. Would not order from this seller again. Still waiting on correct product.

Input:This eyeliner is easy to use, but is not waterproof and does not stay on when applied.  I used it on dry eyelids but it cannot be applied once - you need to do it a few times to get a perfect line.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This is an extremely well-made unit and appears completely waterproof.  It charges in about an hour with a charge that lasts me four showers.  While it removes some skin I would prefer stiffer rubber “bristles.”  The handle is made of a slippery plastic that is impossible to hang into with soapy hands.  Probably OK for the bathtub, but risky in the shower.  Men usually have larger backs and are less flexible.  So I made a longer “handle” with a 12” PVC pipe, attached with a gasket and a hose clamp, easily removed for charging.  The pipe also doesn’t slip in a soapy hand.  With all the running gear in the head the unit is top heavy when in the charger.  Even the suction cups on the charger base can’t hold it upright.  However, the gasket for the handle also pushes the unit enough off center to balance it and prevent fall overs.  The instruction sheet is a riot.  It reads like it was run from Chinese through a translation program into “English.”  The best line is “Especially designed with horny brush and thus removing residual horniness.”  If only it were so simple!  It should be rewritten by a native English speaker.

Input:I love this sunscreen. It's perfect for those who need a little bit of color any time of the year. Even if you are pale, have no fear - even when you spread it on it will absorb into your skin and give you the right amount of color.<br /><br /> It also seems to even out my reddish skin. I could see myself using this a lot in the summer. This has been my favorite product from this line!
Output:positive
Input:I have tried most razors on the market from older dual edge, single blade razors to the new three blade disposable razors (I have not tried any of the new quad-configuration razors, however.) Of all the razors I have tried, my overall favorite is the Gillette Sensor Excel. The combination of shaving closeness and relatively long blade life make this razor a good choice for most people.<br /><br />The bottom line is that these blades provide an optimum, smooth shave and last a long time, which is why I continue to use them despite the relatively high cost. The most economical way to buy these blades is in the 15-cartridge pack; so if you like the Sensor Excel like I do, this package is the best value you will find. I give the Sensor Excel five stars for technical merit, even though the replacement blades are quite expensive.

Input:I upgraded from a Norelco 6865XL that I've had for about 5 years or so, and the 9160XL makes a world of difference. There are minor improvements - I like the color, it seems to clean easier, and the battery lasts a LOT longer. I haven't re-charged it yet after three weeks of continuous use, and I have half a battery left. But the vastly superior feature to the 9160 is clearly the increased size of the shaving surface. Instead of one ring of cutters per head, there are now three, leaving virtually no open space on the razor head to miss your face. For me, I would say shaving now takes - coincidentally - 1/3rd as long and I get a much better shave for it.<br /><br />Other nice additions I like are the more intelligent placement of the ""small"" holes for the cutters.

Input:I'm kind of disappointed by this product.  The USB plug is in such an awkward place right on bottom of the chin.  I like to prop myself up when wearing the mask so the cord is always stabbing me in the chest and it bends the cord which can't be good for it. Also the mask is huge if I line my eyes up to the eye holes my chins is where the mouth hole is. The rubber on the eye holes is so uncomfortable. The strap to hold it on your face is so hard to put on the mask and is so uncomfortable. Now as far as how it works I can't really review that yet I need more time of using it.  I got the mask thinking it would be easier than the hand helds but now I'm unsure.

Decided to go for this one as I was looking for something as natural as I could find. After having it for 2 weeks - I can tell you, it's definitely a win. My skin is still kinda itchy... but not so bad. And I had a lot of acne as well - because of itching and scratching. Now I can see it reducing.<br /><br />First the structure of the butter was kinda weird to me. I've never used a butter before. It seemed more like a scrub to me. But I decided to try it out.

Input:When I read the product page, it sounded like this foot cream had some of the same ingredients as some of my favorite lotions, so I thought it would help soften my rough, cracked feet. It wasn’t until the package arrived that I saw what was REALLY in this product, and I was NOT pleased. However, I was willing to give it a try.<br /><br />Aside from the aloe, green tea leaf extract, water and coconut oil, many ingredients in this cream are kind gross or not helpful. The complete list is: urea, salicylic acid, deionized water, green tea leaf extract, coconut oil, dodecane, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, clyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, cetyl alcohol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, tea tree oil, glycerin, propylene glycol, carbomer, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyethanol.<br /><br />The gross part is the main ingredient: 40% urea—a major component of urine. Salicylic acid is used in wart-removing solutions because it exfoliates your skin. Dodecane is a chemical used in jet fuel which can cause skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation. Alcohol dries out your skin. Xanthan gum is just a thickening agent made of corn. I am personally allergic to that and stearates. And the other chemicals are kind of sketchy, too.<br /><br />I tried this stuff on my feet for a couple of weeks, applying before I went to bed and wearing socks to protect my sheets. I really didn’t see any significant change in the condition of my feet than when I apply regular alcohol-free lotion. It makes no sense to me that anyone would use this stuff so full of questionable chemicals, paying $27 for a little pot of this cream, when a regular bottle of lotion works just as good or better and goes for a fraction of the cost.

Input:The best thing about this serum is that it's completely non greasy. It feels like putting thickened water on your face, but instead of evaporating, it stays on your face and continues to moisturize. I have been using it as a lightweight moisturizer after i wash my face with either an AHA or BHA facewash, so that it really sinks in. That said, it is not enough to use it as a standalone moisturizer, probably exactly because it's non greasy and doesn't create a barrier on your face to keep the moisture in. It says on the bottle to follow up with a moisturizer, and I will but I wanted to test it out alone first.<br />I really like the dropper packaging - you can be very exact about how much serum you're using. I have tried it with different amounts. Today I used only 1/3 of a dropper, and I still feel like it was too much product so next time I will try it will 1/4 dropper. It comes shipped with a screw on cap that you can save and use for travel.<br />I have to say that this really does work. My face feels plump and moisturized with no tight feeling on the surface. It's light enough to put even under my eyes and I don't fear that it will cause millia or clogged pores. I don't have a lot of fine lines yet (36), but my skin is prone to flaking and this takes care of that, all day.<br />It has a very light smell - kind of herbal, but light and inoffensive.<br />I should mention that I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review, and that I have tested and reviewed to the best of my ability.

The balm goes on smoothly and has a nice consistency.<br /><br />What I dislike is that it goes quickly.  Also... BHT.  BHT is banned in the US for baby foods.  It's also banned in the UK.  Obviously I'm not going to take a chance with my kids, so I won't be buying more unless Nivea changes their formulation.

Input:Maybe it's because I don't have that much knowledge on braiding/twisting idk. This is the third time I've done my own hair and it worked for me I wanted an uneven end style and that's what I got. I rubber banded my ends for the choppy look. Everyone loved it so I don't have any complaints lol.

Input:As beard oils go, I dig this one. It's not too heavy, doesn't leave a greasy residue, and does a fine job at keeping the old beard soft and my skin non-flaky. And I love the scent. The only things I don't like are a) while the scent is great, I wish it were slightly stronger and b) the pump bottle kind of annoys me.<br /><br />Quibbles aside, fine product.
Output:positive
Input:The hair arrived in a day, so I was super excited about installing the braids. When I opened the pack, they had a slight smell as if they had been sitting up in a storage room or something, but it wasn't to the point where I had to wash them beforehand. They are a medium-small size, and I used 6 packs to cover my whole head.<br /><br />I would have given 5 full stars, but the flyaways (the hair that sticks out as you braid) were noticeable in all six packs. Other than that, they do not weigh my head down, and they are super soft to the touch.

Input:Coconut does smell like buttered popcorn. Like going to the movie theater and buying the butter straight on your lips. 😝 Lotion has a better smell than the balm.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve had these installed for about 2 weeks. I’ve only washed them about 3 times. They get progressively worse and worse each day. I spend asinine amounts of money on high end hair products and oils. I absolutely HAVE to braid the hair and oil it at night otherwise I wake up with dreadlocks. It’s the worst hair I’ve ever had. I had high hopes from some of the reviews PLUS I probably bought 20 packs total of their tape in extensions a couple years ago. I much prefer the sew-in method now so was hoping these would be great. They’re not. I swear it’s a blend of synthetic or animal hair with maybe a few strands of human hair. Some parts of my hair dont even curl. Really upset

Input:One of my new favorite concealers. Super smooth when applied and it does not oxidize or congeal awkwardly under the eyes like some other concealers do. I use it for under my eyes and to cover light blemishes and it works perfectly. I love the texture, it feels like velvet. Coverage is light-medium --- good for dark under eye circles or occasional acne spots. I would not recommend this to cover severe acne or discoloration, since it won't provide ideal coverage. It lasts for most of the day, I typically reapply in the evening (after about 10-12 hours) if I need it. I have not tested the concealer in climates over 70F (21C), but in cooler fall/winter climates it works well. My skin is normal and pretty light to begin with (caucasian) so I got the shade 01 which was a perfect fit. I would definitely recommend this product and I will order again.

I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**<br /><br />This review is on a few products from Retseliney. These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days. The products are featured on Amazon for slightly under $20 and improve skin tone and texture. The products get down under the skin to remove old dead skin cells and clear up impurities. All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic product.<br /><br />The cream is white and has no fragrance. When applied to the skin it has a rough, sandy texture to it and if this does not irritate your sensitive skin, then you will find that it removes a lot of the blackheads, whiteheads and dead skin cells that leave your face looking dull and unhealthy. VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see results.<br /><br />The fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new. The skin will be even and have less blemishes and feel soft to the touch. I highly recommend these products!

Input:I've only been using this product for few days but it has already shown lots of improvement in the clear, clean, soft, and natural younger glowing face that was not so long ago affected by stress induced adult acne and clogged pores. I have also been using 4 other products (InstaNatural) in my routine daily (morn & night) for few days longer and highly recommend ALL Of THEIR PRODUCTS based on how fast I have noticed such amazing results by using only their products (morn n night) b4 applying any make-up but have also proudly been able to go out without any make-up & I'm not insecure, I love it!!! :)

Input:I love it. Natural 4b/c hair, thick, coarse, tends to be very dry and tangled. I don't use much conditioner - hairdressing - due to scalp irritation. I only use shea butter. THIS BRUSH MAKES IT SO EASY TO DETANGLE MY HAIR. I have chronic fatigue and shampooing is usually such a hassle especially having to comb out and braid hair after a wash. (exhausting process)<br /><br />I use the brush when my hair is damp but not wet, or I spritz with water and use this and my hair is instantly detangled and sorta like a blowout. Repeated strokes will make it straighter but I don't need it really straight, just healthy manageable and detangled. My hair feels happy and softer, not dried hard crunchy or stiff.(like it usually is)hehe<br /><br /> So in other words the gentle steam effect is wonderful. I know I'm using it wrong but its working for me. :D I will never live without this brush or another like it. The torment of hairbrushing is over.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This is a nice product but for the price there isn't enough of it.AND. it contains BHT.<br /><br />What I like is the scent and the way it softens my lips.  The balm goes on smoothly and has a nice consistency.<br /><br />What I dislike is that it goes quickly.  Also... BHT.  BHT is banned in the US for baby foods.  It's also banned in the UK.  Obviously I'm not going to take a chance with my kids, so I won't be buying more unless Nivea changes their formulation.

Input:Maybe it's because I don't have that much knowledge on braiding/twisting idk. This is the third time I've done my own hair and it worked for me I wanted an uneven end style and that's what I got. I rubber banded my ends for the choppy look. Everyone loved it so I don't have any complaints lol.
Output:positive
Input:As beard oils go, I dig this one. It's not too heavy, doesn't leave a greasy residue, and does a fine job at keeping the old beard soft and my skin non-flaky. And I love the scent. The only things I don't like are a) while the scent is great, I wish it were slightly stronger and b) the pump bottle kind of annoys me.<br /><br />Quibbles aside, fine product.
Output:positive
Input:The hair arrived in a day, so I was super excited about installing the braids. When I opened the pack, they had a slight smell as if they had been sitting up in a storage room or something, but it wasn't to the point where I had to wash them beforehand. They are a medium-small size, and I used 6 packs to cover my whole head.<br /><br />I would have given 5 full stars, but the flyaways (the hair that sticks out as you braid) were noticeable in all six packs. Other than that, they do not weigh my head down, and they are super soft to the touch.
Output:positive
Input:Coconut does smell like buttered popcorn. Like going to the movie theater and buying the butter straight on your lips. 😝 Lotion has a better smell than the balm.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve had these installed for about 2 weeks. I’ve only washed them about 3 times. They get progressively worse and worse each day. I spend asinine amounts of money on high end hair products and oils. I absolutely HAVE to braid the hair and oil it at night otherwise I wake up with dreadlocks. It’s the worst hair I’ve ever had. I had high hopes from some of the reviews PLUS I probably bought 20 packs total of their tape in extensions a couple years ago. I much prefer the sew-in method now so was hoping these would be great. They’re not. I swear it’s a blend of synthetic or animal hair with maybe a few strands of human hair. Some parts of my hair dont even curl. Really upset

Input:One of my new favorite concealers. Super smooth when applied and it does not oxidize or congeal awkwardly under the eyes like some other concealers do. I use it for under my eyes and to cover light blemishes and it works perfectly. I love the texture, it feels like velvet. Coverage is light-medium --- good for dark under eye circles or occasional acne spots. I would not recommend this to cover severe acne or discoloration, since it won't provide ideal coverage. It lasts for most of the day, I typically reapply in the evening (after about 10-12 hours) if I need it. I have not tested the concealer in climates over 70F (21C), but in cooler fall/winter climates it works well. My skin is normal and pretty light to begin with (caucasian) so I got the shade 01 which was a perfect fit. I would definitely recommend this product and I will order again.

Input:I purchased these for myself as previously I have used clip ins by s-noilite and enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same about these tape ins. As a licensed cosmetologist I'm very disappointed in the quality of these extensions. As these were only for personal use it was fine but I would never use these on a client even if they are a more affordable option. They are extremely thin at the ends. They claim this is to give them a natural look which I thought would be great because hair does naturally get thinner at the end but they look ridiculous. They only lasted on my hair for a day before they started to fall out. The tape is very weak and I doubt it would last a wash (mind you I even ran the straightener on them to try to get them to last longer). Therefore, the extra tape is useless and when I did wear them my boyfriend commented the ends looked very thin and made my hair look unhealthy and frizzy. I've thought of cutting the thin ends but its so much length I would have to cut off which is the whole reason I paid extra and got the 18"" in the first place. Regardless, I give these 2 stars because the color is exactly the same as in the picture and the quality of the hair itself is decent.

Bottom line, good for your hair but seriously aggravating. I've had at least four pump top failures in two tears.

Input:The ""hair"" of the wig is exactly like one I bought for Halloween years ago.  It is real shiny and very obviously synthetic.  I ordered it on May 3rd and did not receive it until yesterday, July 24th.  It is a total piece of junk, so I wanted to return it. Amazon's return policy is SUPPOSED to be 30 days after receipt of the product.  However, they would not allow me to return it today, July 25th.  They said it had to be returned by July 22nd, TWO DAYS BEFORE I GOT THE MERCHANDISE.  I spent 30 minutes reading their policy and tried in vane to find out how to return an item that was not received on time.  I wanted to return it the day after I got it.  Their policy states that I have 30 days after receiving the item, but they will not let me return it. I've only had to return a few items since being a Prime member, and it always went smoothly, but be advised that if you have a situation liKe MINE there is NO WAY to contact Amazon.  The only complaint I have about the seller is that it took longer than promised.  MY MAIN problem is with AMAZON for not honoring their policy of allowing me to return it 30 days after receipt of the item.

Input:I have been using Norelco razors for the last 10 years. I always buy the latest one that comes out. This is probably the best razor money can buy. It gives me a closer shave in less time than the previous model. The biggest difference was noriced when I shaved this morning. I had not shaved in 36 hours and it took the same time to shave as if I had 12 hours before.<br />It is defintely the coolest looking shaver.<br /><br />A few negatives about this compared to the previous one I had:<br /><br />It is louder, battery only lasts 65 min vs 100 on the older one, the old one told you how long you shaved for, you have to clean it every 2 shaves. Although this is annoying it only takes about 10 seconds to clean. ALso despite the fact that this is a small razor it takes more space to travel with if you use the included case. I will be using an older case for short trips.

Input:I have been wearing tape extensions for years. I have tried so many brands on Amazon and eBay and up until now, have never been satisfied. I have had these installed for 2 weeks and I must say, the hair is amazing. I have washed it and it still feels so good. It doesn’t tangle at all so far. It’s not itchy either. And the color matches my hair perfectly. My only issue I have had so far is the tapes are horrible. I had them professionally installed and after 4 days I went to wash my hair and as soon as my hair was soaked they all started sliding out. I hadn’t even used any product yet. The tapes basically Disintegrated because there wasn’t even any residue left in my hair. I have never had that happen before. So you might want to retape before applying them. I retaped them and put them back in and have had no issues thus far. Definitely recommend them. The tapes may suck but the hair is amazing. I will only order from this brand from now on.

Input:There are not enough positive words to express how wonderful Hairy Sanity has been for my daughter.  In just one week since we received the product, her hair is so much softer, shinier and just about flake free.<br /><br />An added bonus is that it smells fabulous.  She complained all of the time about using dandruff shampoo.  At 14 years old the smell is a huge deal.  She loves this and if it continues to work on her dry scalp, it's totally worth the price.<br /><br />Teens are super self conscious and her flakes on her black tops were driving her mad.  She just wore a black dress yesterday and after 12 hours didn't have any white on the shoulders!!!

Then came Bad Hair Days, day after day, hair falling out, weak hair strands, dryness, etc. I got a new stylist and she suggested using Hair Candy. I was extremely doubtful as I already take vitamins. But, I started taking it and within a couple weeks there was a vast improvement. I've been taking 2 or 3 capsules everyday for over a year now and I am THRILLED with Hair Candy! It is well worth the price. My long hair has changed dramatically! Now I love my hair again!

There’s just no way to get them to clamp on where they need to so that they look natural. And if you do get them on, it’s almost impossible to get them off without causing damage to your natural lashes. I figured the idea of these would be good to be true and I was right.

Input:Pros: half the cost of a Sonicare w/charger, less bulky<br />Cons: None so far<br /><br />First of all, I should state that I have owned this product for over a year, and I am still giving it five stars.<br /><br />Here's why: I had a Sonicare Advance for about three years and it worked well during that time, but at the end of those three years I had to keep it in the charger at all times or it would die in the middle of brushing. I was sick of lugging around the bulky charger any time I traveled, so when I saw the AA-battery model at Target for $40 I scooped it up.<br /><br />Now instead of having to rely on an internal battery and a charger, I just keep four rechargeable AAs that I swap out when one pair dies. This isn't something I have to do very often--a pair of AAs lasts about a month (that's with two two-minute brushings a day). I have also not had any water damage, so the brush still works as great as my old Sonicare ever did. I do try not to get water on the brush and dry the entire unit whenever I finish using it. In addition, I take it apart once every two or three months and swab the O-ring with alcohol to keep it clean. This seems to be all of the maintenance needed to keep it in top condition.<br /><br />So, if you want a good Sonicare brush that takes up less space and is easier to travel with, I highly recommend this model. I recommend cleaning it once in a while and trying to keep water out of the insides. I acknowledge this might not help if you get a bad unit (as many reviewers seem to have gotten), but mine has been great and I figure it can't hurt!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have now owned it for a year-and-a-half and it still goes a month on two AA rechargeables. Even though I stopped doing the maintenance described above it's still working like new.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product.

Input:The ""hair"" of the wig is exactly like one I bought for Halloween years ago.  It is real shiny and very obviously synthetic.  I ordered it on May 3rd and did not receive it until yesterday, July 24th.  It is a total piece of junk, so I wanted to return it. Amazon's return policy is SUPPOSED to be 30 days after receipt of the product.  However, they would not allow me to return it today, July 25th.  They said it had to be returned by July 22nd, TWO DAYS BEFORE I GOT THE MERCHANDISE.  I spent 30 minutes reading their policy and tried in vane to find out how to return an item that was not received on time.  I wanted to return it the day after I got it.  Their policy states that I have 30 days after receiving the item, but they will not let me return it. I've only had to return a few items since being a Prime member, and it always went smoothly, but be advised that if you have a situation liKe MINE there is NO WAY to contact Amazon.  The only complaint I have about the seller is that it took longer than promised.  MY MAIN problem is with AMAZON for not honoring their policy of allowing me to return it 30 days after receipt of the item.

Input:I have been using Norelco razors for the last 10 years. I always buy the latest one that comes out. This is probably the best razor money can buy. It gives me a closer shave in less time than the previous model. The biggest difference was noriced when I shaved this morning. I had not shaved in 36 hours and it took the same time to shave as if I had 12 hours before.<br />It is defintely the coolest looking shaver.<br /><br />A few negatives about this compared to the previous one I had:<br /><br />It is louder, battery only lasts 65 min vs 100 on the older one, the old one told you how long you shaved for, you have to clean it every 2 shaves. Although this is annoying it only takes about 10 seconds to clean. ALso despite the fact that this is a small razor it takes more space to travel with if you use the included case. I will be using an older case for short trips.

Input:I have been wearing tape extensions for years. I have tried so many brands on Amazon and eBay and up until now, have never been satisfied. I have had these installed for 2 weeks and I must say, the hair is amazing. I have washed it and it still feels so good. It doesn’t tangle at all so far. It’s not itchy either. And the color matches my hair perfectly. My only issue I have had so far is the tapes are horrible. I had them professionally installed and after 4 days I went to wash my hair and as soon as my hair was soaked they all started sliding out. I hadn’t even used any product yet. The tapes basically Disintegrated because there wasn’t even any residue left in my hair. I have never had that happen before. So you might want to retape before applying them. I retaped them and put them back in and have had no issues thus far. Definitely recommend them. The tapes may suck but the hair is amazing. I will only order from this brand from now on.

Input:There are not enough positive words to express how wonderful Hairy Sanity has been for my daughter.  In just one week since we received the product, her hair is so much softer, shinier and just about flake free.<br /><br />An added bonus is that it smells fabulous.  She complained all of the time about using dandruff shampoo.  At 14 years old the smell is a huge deal.  She loves this and if it continues to work on her dry scalp, it's totally worth the price.<br /><br />Teens are super self conscious and her flakes on her black tops were driving her mad.  She just wore a black dress yesterday and after 12 hours didn't have any white on the shoulders!!!

Input:I went through a few years of poor health and lots of medicine. My hair began to show it. Then came Bad Hair Days, day after day, hair falling out, weak hair strands, dryness, etc. I got a new stylist and she suggested using Hair Candy. I was extremely doubtful as I already take vitamins. But, I started taking it and within a couple weeks there was a vast improvement. I've been taking 2 or 3 capsules everyday for over a year now and I am THRILLED with Hair Candy! It is well worth the price. My long hair has changed dramatically! Now I love my hair again!

Input:I pre cleaned my face. Applied for 15 minutes washed.  Then used witch hazle and was still wiping traces of oil and dirt. Now I wash my face everyday but my pores are large product did not shrink appearance as stated.  Not to add I had to Google instructions not in English.
Output:negative
Input:I have one of this before and use it for couple years then I lost it. So I still bought the same comb to use. Good product no more fuzzy
Output:positive
Input:The bundles are very thin! I did a return and have been going back and forth for days now trying to get my refund the vendor keeps telling me they will send me more bundles instead why would I want more poor quality hair?! I’ve asked five times now for a refund. I have finally called customer service to still not be helped and to be told they have to look into the issue before giving a refund! Why?! I returned the product give me my money back now!

Ġkeeps,Ġhave,"Input:Brought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. It holds all her make up, keeps it organized and it’s easy to travel with.
Output:positive
Input:Love this shampoo and conditioner. Great scent but not over powering. I have a sensitive scalp and this is the only brand that keeps my scalp from drying out and being itchy. Only down fall is one of the bottle came broken.
Output:positive
Input:I use this product daily as I have curly hair and this seems to be the only thing that keeps it under control without having to use a harsh gel. My hair is actually softer to the touch and I like the fragrance (very mild)  it leaves.
Output:positive
Input:useless. keeps falling DON'T BUY
Output:negative
Input:If you have reasonably thick or long hair, have zero time/patience/skill and are looking for a quick way to look presentable for work, this comb/pin thing is great. I haven't tried all the styles pictured but I often wear a low &#34;knot&#34; style bun, and this thing keeps it in place as well or better than other methods I've tried (including using a a gazillion bobby pins, or a couple of  those &#34;corkscrew&#34; pins) and in less time. It takes a bit of judgement to wedge it in comfortably without the prongs pushing against your scalp. One star off because it's pretty large (the ends will show unless you have a LOT of hair) and because I've noticed the two central prongs do deform a bit with use. You can easily bend them back so that all 4 prongs are parallel again - but I suspect over time the metal will fatigue. But with two units in the pack, you have a backup if one breaks.
Output:positive
Input:The wig was heavy.  The color not as pictured. I ordered because i love the color pink. The wig keeps sliding off. Too long.
Output:negative
Input:I LOVE this cream.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and in the pool, especially in the summertime. After being in the hot, Houston sun, this cream  keeps my skin (face and neck) nicely moisturized.  It's also wonderful if you have really dry, or sensitive skin - hands, feet, elbows, etc. It has a rich, luxurious, texture that feels wonderful.
Output:positive
Input:Terrible hair is a tangled mess doesn't even lay on your head just keeps getting matted up. STAY CLEAR FROM THIS HAIR
Output:negative
Input:This was not what I was expecting.  The little plastic piece to separate the bristles keeps falling off and when I am trying to brush my hair.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve been using this product since 1978, and I was totally bummed out when it was removed off the shelves.<br />It really keeps you dry, and smells so good.<br />I’m just glad to be able to buy it here.
Output:positive
Input:I don't want to wash my hair right before bed, but I need to get rid of all of the rest of the day's filth. The shower cap works exactly as expected; keeps my hair dry! And I couldn't be happier.
Output:positive
Input:I’ve had this curling iron for 5 years. Everyone that has seen it always questions me on what it is. This hair tool is the best! It keeps your hair curled for days! I can usually wear my hair curly for 2 days. Day 2 you just do a quick touch up and you’re good as new! I get creative with my hair and I’ll wrap my hair around the bubbles then go in between. Give you a perfect wavy/beach curl!
Output:positive
Input:I apply this product right after the body hydration. It locks in the moisture and keeps my skin silky smooth so when I wake up in the morning I’m ready to take on the day.<br /><br />Jack Black is a fantastic brand for body skin care. You owe it to yourself as a man to at least try it.
Output:positive
Input:I like that this product is safe for dogs and the peppermint smell dwindles but still keeps ants away from our sliding glass door, front door, and garage. Living in Florida ants are a problem and this product is safe in cupboards, as well.
Output:positive
Input:I love this stuff. I bought directly from the company and got this one and some other samples. I loved the lime coconut the best. I feel like I’m at the beach. It keeps me dry and stink free for about 24 hours. I’d been using the Thai deodorant rock for about 2 years but it started to fail. So I gave this a try. I’ve been using it exclusively for about 5 months and I couldn’t be happier.
