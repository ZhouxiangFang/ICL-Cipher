Input:I bought this wig because the product photos looked amazing, however this wig is definitely not the same as advertised. The pigtails are extremely uneven (can’t be adjusted because pigtails have already been cut). There are random straight cuts on the sides of the wigs that aren’t for the bangs as seen in the picture which do not blend in at all. The wig weft directions for the bangs are not the same as the picture, as there should be a distinctive separation for the front bags from the skin top middle part. The wig is thin and there is only one darker shade of blue added in where the product picture shows two different shades. Cosplayers, do not waste your money on this wig.

Input:[[VIDEOID:e5fbad9e4bbe7d8ba4d5445424d22b17]] This is the 1st time I have ever wasted money buying hair on amazon. The hair did come same day. However, this is NOT kinky straight hair, the seller needs to change that on their product. The bundles are three different textures 18 inch is silky straight with a braid look. The 16inc bundles was more of a 2B wavy text texture. The 12 inch was the texture of a braid out on permed hair... still not kinky. I thought I could work with to get the result I wanted, since I've been doing hair for years. Still that did not work. The bundles are not full. The ends are bone straight for some reason. You cant flat iron the thicker bundles straight it has crinkles in it. So you can see all the different texture when you install the bundles. The closure is a 4th texture, it doesnt blend at all, not sure why it was even included.
Output:negative
Input:i love the fact that it pops right on !  and it stays on  until you take it off . the cons are the lashes itself dont stand up to wear and tear after 2 applications the lash gets torn or limpy ..i wouldnt take a shower with water hitting your face the glue will hold with the moisture but the curl in the lash will become limp and straight.
Output:positive
Input:Unfortunately the product does not work well on thick curly hair. the maximum heat on the product is 250 degrees and it took an hour to try to straighten a quarter of my hair and it did not do that well. If you have thin fine hair that is wavy, it may work for you but for the people that have thick curly hair... don't waste your money.
Output:negative
Input:Horrible product it didn’t straighten my hair as described .....took forever to heat up .....very disappointed I returned a product immediately
Output:negative
Input:The long lighter blonde pieces were stick straight.  No way to style to keep them from sticking out.  Made the hair piece look very cheap and fake.
Output:negative
Input:I am an older woman with hairstyles like pixies, Mohawks, etc. I have thick, straight, course hair, and am always looking for a product that will hold yet be flexible at the same time. One morning I went to babysit my grandson, and I found this product in m son’s bathroom. I love it! I loved it so much I ordered some the same day. It goes on clear. It doesn’t turn my hair blue or white like other products, and it is super easy to use.
Output:positive
Input:I've used the product off and on for about 2 years. I, too, bought it for the color effect. Unfortunately, it has had zero effect on the color of my beard. It remains grey. If I have an interview or something, I have to resort to something like Just for Men Beard and Mustache. On numerous occasions, I've used it for a couple of weeks straight. Nothing. And a few times I've tried back to back washings or two or three washings in a day. That often leads to skin burn, so that is out too. Won't buy again, but it was worth the shot. Smells nice!
Output:negative
Input:This hair is AWFUL!! Hair is extremely stiff, definitely not true to length. I ordered 10, 12 and 14. I only used the 14 and the 12. The 14 is shorter than the 12, and the 12 could definitely go for 10 inches. The hair had the absolute worse chemical smell to it, that I still can't get out. I give one star because it does take bleach and dye well. However, the hair has no body/bounce to it, stiff as a board. I guess you get what you pay for. I will NEVER order from this vendor again. I ordered the hair on Thursday and received it on Saturday. Installed the hair and it probably won't be long before I take it out. If the hair.... and that's a BIG ""if"", the hair make it three weeks, I'll come back and update. Until then I would not recommend. Worst kinky straight hair I have ever received. I'm disappointed in Amazon for having such a vendor on their website 🙄😔😡🤬

I have a leave abs or matches my hair texture perfectly !!!! highly recommend this product!!!!
Output:positive
Input:Heats up quick and I like the locking feature. Straightens my thick curly hair easily and way quicker than using a flat iron. TIP - use your regular brush with the straightening brush at the same time, one on either side of the section of hair you are brushing. This produces more tension and as a result straighter hair with less strokes needed.
Output:positive
Input:Attempted to use on bikini area and it tore my skin to pieces within seconds, causing me to bleed.  Went straight into the trash.

Output:negative
Input:I bought this for travel, and the bag's zipper broke before I could even get my bags packed. The jars were fine but the bottles leaked and were unusable. Complete waste of money.
Output:negative
Input:It came with dirt and mold type all over the box and inside too,  never again buying it. Scared to use product due to how it came 😕 waste of money
Output:negative
Input:Takes a very long time to dry! As I pet groomer I always used piggy paint because its made for kids so dried fast and non toxic but figured I'd try this because her its made for pets. It doesn't dry fast and definitely takes more then one coat. Don't waste your money.

Output:negative
Input:I bought this hair and brought it to my stylist to save money and she was so impressed with the quality that she bought some for herself to use for her clients. My own hair is terribly thin so I decided not to reinstall after 6 weeks of compliments and loving having this glorious shiny hair. I decided to be crafty and order a cheap synthetic clip in set for about $10 on ebay and cut the synthetic hair off save an inch or so and then recycled my beautiful tape ins by installing them to the clip in set. Works perfectly and I can take it off and on without the damage having the tape ins caused.

Output:negative
Input:So to use this, you plug the mouth piece into a battery. The battery on my 1st purchase didn't turn on after hours of charging. So they replaced it. The 2nd one worked at first. Then I put it in storage for a few months, and when I took it back out to use it again, the battery won't work. It's the same problem, it's been on the charger for hours, and it won't turn on.

Input:I have used Manic Panic Purple Haze for years.  I finally decided to try the Amplified, as it allegedly lasts longer.  First, the color is different than the traditional formula.  Second, and far worse, it faded FASTER!  My purple streaks were brownish within three days.  I got the Amplified Vampire Red (I do streaks of 3 different colors), and it faded fast, but not as fast as the purple.  Save your money and time, get the regular Manic Panic.  The seller was fine, product arrived on time.

Ġclip,Ġmany,"Input:Didn’t work for me.  One clip broke off right away.
Output:negative
Input:Great clip. Sturdy enough to hold my waist length hair in a bun.
Output:positive
Input:Product looks sturdy and pretty but I never had a hair clip that would pull my hair out. I had to throw them away.
Output:negative
Input:Ok I don’t ever write review but for this was a must. First off material it says metal, it is not metal the little hair clip is metal but the butterfly itself is like a thick piece of paper. I spent $10 on a piece of paper I could have printed myself with a hair clip I could have taken off of my kids bows so it would have not cost me a thing. False advertising don’t waste your money like at all
Output:negative
Input:The Philips Norelco QC5055 clipper works wonderful if you do not have thick and full hair or do extensive hair cutting. It is good for maintaining a short haircut or shaving a beard. However, if you have lots of hair, I recommend a traditional clipper due to a wider cutting area and sheer power. The unit feels solid and heavy, but the plastics are a little on the cheap side. The cordless feature is convenient, especially if you cut your hair outside. No more extension cords. On the downside, rechargeability makes the unit lack in cutting power at times and you need to manage a separate charging base. Overall for the price, this is a good unit, just don't expect professional salon quality cuts and build quality.
Output:positive
Input:Only works if your hair is thin and all the same length. Tried to use it and finally got it with the small &#34;donut&#34; to stay.... But no matter how hard I tried I could not get my hair to cover the bulky clip. Plus the clip is extremely hard to snap together once you have rolled your hair around it. Would've been better off cutting a sock and using that instead of wasting $10 for this junk.
Output:negative
Input:I have an older than old Wahl clipper and with slight trimming of the rubber boot that secures the power cord in the unit, it fit right in. Also, one wire was longer than my original wire so I rerouted it without having to cut, shorten and reattach the terminal end. Very pleased!
Output:positive
Input:I love how the clip is very sturdy and really grabs on to the extensions. I imagined the bad to be bigger (I don't know why) but its a good size!
Output:positive
Input:Hard to keeping your hair because of the clip
Output:negative
Input:Amazing soft comfortable ears that stay on, tho I would recommend they add another clip to the ears so they don't wabble around.
Output:positive
Input:These aren't very easy to put on.  I can't get them to lay on my eyelashes long enough to clip together.  I guess it works for some people, just not me.  YMMV.
Output:negative
Input:I've been happy with this clip.  The spring on my old Goody clip finally bit the dust and finding a quality replacement in a large 5 inches size is quite challenging.  I find that most clips nowadays are made with a brittle type of plastic that when I inevitably drop it on my tile floor, a tooth or two on the clip can easily break off.  This clip seems to be made of the more pliable or soft plastic like my old Goody clip was made of - so drops don't result in a tooth shattering off the clip.  I also really like the low profile of the tabs for your fingers on the back of the clip - they don't protrude nearly as much as on a regular clip and I like that.  I also like the tortoise shell color - it blends in well with my hair color. I was willing to pay for a quality clip that would last and I am happy with this purchase.  I like to have a few around the house for whenever or wherever I need them (cooking in the kitchen, in the bathroom for brushing teeth/washing face, in my suitcase, etc.)  I will definitely be buying a couple more.<br /><br />UPDATE: July 2019 - I still really like this clip and use one every day (I own several) however I've now had two break within a couple of months of purchase.  One was at 3 months and one at 8 months. I can't remember what broke on the first one but this last one the spring didn't break - it was the plastic that holds the spring that twisted and will no longer hold the spring (see photo.)  I love these clips because I have very long hair and they do hold my hair, but at $10 each I wish they lasted longer than 3 or 8 months.  I had a Goody clip that lasted at least 15 years before it finally failed (spring broke) - too bad Goody no longer sells the super large clips.  3 stars off for the poor durability of this product.
Output:negative
Input:This was mandatory for my daughter's recital.  It's an incredibly heavy flower for the type of clip provided, so it hangs awkwardly and falls out frequently, even with normal movement.  When I pulled it out of the plastic bag provided, the bag was completely lined with red color that had come off of the flower in shipping.  The flower is still red, but it sheds.  Considering this was a TEN dollar clip, I wouldn't expect a shedding flower, big globs of glue or a giant flower that can't be supported with an inappropriately tiny clip. And yet....
Output:negative
Input:I bought this product after I had to return another brand's clipper (because its surface got very hot during its use). This one has a plastic plate over that metal part to protect you from heat, it has no useless gadgets to store as the other one did, the three adjustable combs cover every need, it's very easy to keep it clean, no extra maintenance, it works perfect as a cordless, and makes accurate cuts fast. Really user friendly! I am just an average mom, not a hairstylist, but I cut three different styles for my hubby, my son, and for MYSELF (all about 1"" on the scruff but very different everywhere else), and I always get compliments on them!

Ġany,ĠâĢľ,"Input:Run from this product! We received blades, not in any official packaging but my husband put them in his razor anyway. He decided to use them but it did not take long to determine they were worse than the blades he replaced. My husband attempted to use them for weeks but there was no improvement so we had to order some from another Amazon vendor.  The information I received from the company is to keep using them and they should get better.
Output:negative
Input:I wear waterproof everything and there are lanyards wipes that can't take it off, these are added to that list. I usually buy the neutrogena wipes because they are the only ones that actually work, but I don't like the residue feeling they leave after. Reason why I have been trying to find other wipes, but these aren't it. First when they were delivered, they and inside package was wet all over. Wipes barely removed any makeup and seemed dry. There is a light pleasant scent. I guess you could use them just to wipe your face and body to feel refreshed, but dont expect them to do much more.
Output:negative
Input:I’m really upset with the quality of these tattoos. I thought they were going to be a little bit bigger. These things are TINY. Barley any of them were usable because they were so small. The only ones that were decent size were the metallic ones and they weren’t the best quality tattoos either.
Output:negative
Input:It helped a little but its still hard for me to breathe in a mask.<br />If you can wear a mask and not have any breathing issues then this is a big help.  But for me I prefer the shields so that I can breathe in ""air""

Input:This isn’t 100% human hair...it tangles and doesn’t stick for more than a day....this is a rip off and I will not ever purchase hair from this company again. I should’ve believed the other one star reviews...I have had the hair in for about 24 hours...and almost all of them have come out. This company knows they’re ripping people off and Amazon makes any paying vendor look good no matter the complaints. Money wasted.

Input:These worked great for push-up lotion bars. I didn't have any problems with leaking with any of the tubes in the pack, I think that would depend on your formula. If you put the containers in the freezer while you work, it will help the liquid solidify upon contact with the tube.
Output:positive
Input:This is the first (obviously I haven't tried them all, but I have tried several) non-aluminum deodorant that actually works.  I like this fragrance too.  You need to do as directed and let the product dry (not that it's terribly wet any way, but it does take a minute) to set.
Output:positive
Input:This was the best buy! I loved getting lots of tips because I will simply keep one tip on forever if I don't have any replacements left. I was concerned about the reviews that said they were rougher than in the past but I did not have this problem. Of course, I had older tips on, which were somewhat rough due to wear. This brush has helped me keep my gums very happy. It is a great buy. The only drawback is that there is so much packaging as each set of two comes with its own package. At least the cardboard is recyclable.

Input:Disclaimer: Full disclosure, I'm a member of Era Organic's VIP club. It costs nothing to me and I receive discount codes should I elect to purchase products on Amazon.

After scrubbing thoroughly it rinsed well. Shampoo's job done. Squeaky clean. No tea tree-like tingle, no surprises, meets expectation.<br /><br />The conditioner is thick, white, barely scented. It goes on beautifully and coats without weighing and slicking it down. I usually apply, tie a bun and body wash while it absorbs 2-6 minutes. The conditioner instantly appears as the big winner to me. In the shower, I had a giddy anticipation once I felt the way it rinsed off. The way my hair felt damp invited confidence.<br /><br />I let my hair air dry, applied no products and assessed when dry: soft, silky, clean. Hair texture was dialed down from its usual puzzling, frizzy coarse to pleasantly manageable. I get this feeling at the salon with high test stuff, water filtration systems and the like. I live in New England and have hard water and 15 year old pipes/water heater. No fancy shower conditions.<br /><br />Summary: Through three consecutive uses, results were similar. Using Aquage (frizz taming gel) my hair went greasy quickly. The current cost of these products and bottle size makes it illogical to pursue in my case. I need huge economy bottles for my amount of hair.<br /><br />Your results will vary. Your monetary situation will vary. I rate this 5/5 quality and overall result. 5/5 customer service, delivery etc. 3.5/5 on economy pricing, size etc.<br /><br />ALL of these ratings are specifically my own situation. I hope being thorough can aid someone in any way. I have no allergies to dyes, perfumes or ingredients.<br /><br />Happy hair day to you!

Input:I have owned several Norelco electric razors in the past and I have always thought that they provided a consistently close shave.  The new Arcitec 1090 gives an even better shave. The flexible heads easily fit the contours of your face and neck better than any previous Norelco model.  There are two minor drawbacks to this razor, well maybe three if you count the exhorbitant price.  The first is the trimmer is usless on this model. Even if the tiny trimmer worked, you could not see what you were trimming because the shaving head blocks your view.  The second irritant is that you have to clean the razor after each use.  Granted, it's a minor annoyance, but if you don't clean it each time you will end up with tiny hair pieces on your clothing and countertop because the collection recepticals are too small to hold more than one days beard growth.

Input:I have a lot of essential oils in my medicine cabinet. However, this was one I didn't have and had never even heard of it. I'm very pleased that I bought it. I can't compare the scent to others since this is my first of this oil.It  has a nice light flowery scent to it. Helichrysum is derived from a sunflower type like plant. It's know for it's healing properties. When used in aromatherapy, helichrysum essential oil is said to fight conditions ranging from allergies and arthritis to eczema and anxiety. It's also said to reduce inflammation, promote the healing of wounds and burns, stimulate digestion, promote detox, boost the immune system, reverse signs of aging in the skin, and fight fungal infections.<br /><br />I use this in my diffuser to help with allergies for myself and my kids. I have noticed less sneezing and coughing when I use this.  I have also used with the coconut oil and lavender oil on my sons dry skin. It seems to help not make his skin so dry and chapped. He has some eczema patches and it's helped those. I also diffuse this in my classroom for a relaxing aroma. I would definitely buy helichrysum  oil again!
Output:positive
Input:Wow. Im going crazy tring to get images of these plates. I tried all the tricks. Dont know what to do. May return them.<br />Ok. Many hour n tryies later..... Finaly. This set does work. But not for beginers. I noticed wiping them with Alot of acetone did help. But the stamper is still crap. Lol
Output:negative
Input:This has been my first time using this product and I love it. It was hard finding a product that would truely help me with my oily skin. I found that this product won't dry my skin out and it doesn't sting me like other products have in the past. The products with the beads usually dry my skin out so having a more natural way to get rid of the imperfections was what I was looking for and I found it! I use this every night. I have less blackheads and smoother skin. I would recommend this product to anyone.
Output:positive
Input:So this was a 2nd purchase.  At first I tried the Bay Rum (single order). I was not really excited about the smell but is was better than BO so I ran with it.  Had a few issues with it not lasting but I know there is a phase you have get through for your body to adjust for not have the antiperspirant, or so I read.  I figured I would try the Lavender next and its a little better but not by much.  I get everyone likes different smells so I am not bashing whether I like the actually smell but more that it prevents the BO.  I used it for my arm pits and under my belly.  The belly sweat didn't go well after a few times maybe a week of use there was a weird odor that was coming from that area.  Was not pleasant. So I am about 6 weeks of full use (not switching to anything else) if I sweat, then my pits do not get the 72 hour claim of protection.  I bathe daily and with the heat maybe 2x a day.  The body odor is not suppressed and I even tried adding a helpful amount to try an prevent. I am a bigger guy and sweat sometimes because of anxiety or stress and was really hoping this would help with any unpleasant odors but doesn't seem to stick.
Output:negative
Input:This product does nothing to help detangle my medium length fine hair. In fact, it seems more snarled than ever after using it. I’ve tried it several times but the results are always the same. I gave it 1 star because it smells nice.
Output:negative
Input:Saw videos on how to use this and as I am pretty savvy with hair.. I couldn’t figure this out for the like of me. I saw to go over the bubbles to help create a beachy wave but it would just not turn out in that way. The bubbles were confusing and the hair didn’t turn into a cute curl. I didn’t care the this style of wand. Unfortunately not for me.
Output:negative
Input:Yes, protection is essential,but comfort is important too. The covers do help with breathing better with a face mask to an extent. However, if you have full lips,and plan on wearing a name brand lipstick, look else where. The slits irritated my lips.
Output:negative
Input:Bought these to see if it would help during day with hot flashes. I don’t really feel any menthol or coolness with them but I really do like the wipe, it has a bumpy side that feels really nice on your skin. They would be great for camping though.
Output:positive
Input:I also received spiral curlers even though the listing and all photos show ripple wave curlers. Then a chat rep told me I ordered the wrong ones and sent me an identical link for a new set. I'm so annoyed by this and of course the replacements can't be sent sooner than one week. Doesn't help at all!!
Output:negative
Input:First of all here are some points to put into consideration before buying. This shaver is for...<br />1. Someone who is looking for a TRAVEL shaver that is small and convenient to carry. It comes with a neat carrying case, and only requires two AA batteries that can be found anywhere. One set of batteries can approx. last up to 20 days/shaves-ish. It will still go on, but I can feel the motor running at lower speed.<br />2. Someone who prefers WET shaving experience whenever possible. (Wet shaving with this product is great. Dry, not so much.)<br />3. Someone who needs to shave everyday or simply want that clean shaven look everyday. ( It's still a foil electric shaver, it's fast, efficient, everyday.)<br />4. Someone who needs his travel shaver to have a trimmer. (Frequent long trip? just like me.)<br />5. Someone who doesn't want to spend 15 minutes cleaning the shaver. Who wants hassle-free and easy cleaning shaver.<br /><br />This shaver however isn't for someone who is looking for a blade replacement shaver. I say, wake up, electric shaver will never give you that baby ""skin"" shave like you get from a proper blade shaving method. However, for $15 this shaver can deliver a very decent shave, very close, but definitely not alike. It also isn't quite for someone who plan to use it 7/365 days. You will probably be better off buying other wet/dry panasonic shaver that is rechargable, and have more than one moving blade, linear-super fast motor and on.<br /><br />It's been a year and I still use it on every one of my trip. no problem. Impeccable reliability there, and well made.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />If you decide to buy it, here are my tips and tricks for you. It's based on my experience with it so perhaps it will help you get a better shave with this shaver.<br />1. YES, it will take up to 2-3 weeks if you are coming from blade for your skin to adjust. This is normal and all you need is patience to get through it.<br />2. It's miles apart better wet shaver than dry. DO NOT shave dry unless absolute necessary.<br />3. With that said, all the techniques in wet shaving apply. You should shave in the shower, or right after you come out of it. Your skin should be clean prior to shaving. One trick is that this shaver works better if your shaving gel/foam/cream is ""light"" or ""not dense"". Lather up too much or a very dense cream can make the foil/blade hot during operation. (Thick cream will cause more friction and blade moves pretty fast.) Last, don't forget a splash of cold water to seal in and a good aftershave.<br />4.DO NOT press the shaver, or foil against your skin. You will only get irritation out of it. The trick is to shave everyday, go against the grain, let it GLIDE SLOWLY on your skin, rinse it whenever you feel there is too much foam in the shaver, use trimmer to take out long stubborn hair like those on the neck, and under the chin. DONE.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I know it's long but this shaver, for $15, deserves a decent review from me imo.

Input:When the nail polish arrived I was thrilled.  I was trying to see each color of the bottle and I do not see a lable on it with the color of the polish.  There is only a number and that does not help out. To see the polich you will have to open up each one to see what the color is.  Very disappointed.....Also the bottles are super small compared to the other gel polishes out there.

Input:I have a lot of essential oils in my medicine cabinet. However, this was one I didn't have and had never even heard of it. I'm very pleased that I bought it. I can't compare the scent to others since this is my first of this oil.It  has a nice light flowery scent to it. Helichrysum is derived from a sunflower type like plant. It's know for it's healing properties. When used in aromatherapy, helichrysum essential oil is said to fight conditions ranging from allergies and arthritis to eczema and anxiety. It's also said to reduce inflammation, promote the healing of wounds and burns, stimulate digestion, promote detox, boost the immune system, reverse signs of aging in the skin, and fight fungal infections.<br /><br />I use this in my diffuser to help with allergies for myself and my kids. I have noticed less sneezing and coughing when I use this.  I have also used with the coconut oil and lavender oil on my sons dry skin. It seems to help not make his skin so dry and chapped. He has some eczema patches and it's helped those. I also diffuse this in my classroom for a relaxing aroma. I would definitely buy helichrysum  oil again!

Input:Wow. Im going crazy tring to get images of these plates. I tried all the tricks. Dont know what to do. May return them.<br />Ok. Many hour n tryies later..... Finaly. This set does work. But not for beginers. I noticed wiping them with Alot of acetone did help. But the stamper is still crap. Lol
Output:negative
Input:This has been my first time using this product and I love it. It was hard finding a product that would truely help me with my oily skin. I found that this product won't dry my skin out and it doesn't sting me like other products have in the past. The products with the beads usually dry my skin out so having a more natural way to get rid of the imperfections was what I was looking for and I found it! I use this every night. I have less blackheads and smoother skin. I would recommend this product to anyone.
Output:positive
Input:So this was a 2nd purchase.  At first I tried the Bay Rum (single order). I was not really excited about the smell but is was better than BO so I ran with it.  Had a few issues with it not lasting but I know there is a phase you have get through for your body to adjust for not have the antiperspirant, or so I read.  I figured I would try the Lavender next and its a little better but not by much.  I get everyone likes different smells so I am not bashing whether I like the actually smell but more that it prevents the BO.  I used it for my arm pits and under my belly.  The belly sweat didn't go well after a few times maybe a week of use there was a weird odor that was coming from that area.  Was not pleasant. So I am about 6 weeks of full use (not switching to anything else) if I sweat, then my pits do not get the 72 hour claim of protection.  I bathe daily and with the heat maybe 2x a day.  The body odor is not suppressed and I even tried adding a helpful amount to try an prevent. I am a bigger guy and sweat sometimes because of anxiety or stress and was really hoping this would help with any unpleasant odors but doesn't seem to stick.
Output:negative
Input:This product does nothing to help detangle my medium length fine hair. In fact, it seems more snarled than ever after using it. I’ve tried it several times but the results are always the same. I gave it 1 star because it smells nice.
Output:negative
Input:Saw videos on how to use this and as I am pretty savvy with hair.. I couldn’t figure this out for the like of me. I saw to go over the bubbles to help create a beachy wave but it would just not turn out in that way. The bubbles were confusing and the hair didn’t turn into a cute curl. I didn’t care the this style of wand. Unfortunately not for me.
Output:negative
Input:Yes, protection is essential,but comfort is important too. The covers do help with breathing better with a face mask to an extent. However, if you have full lips,and plan on wearing a name brand lipstick, look else where. The slits irritated my lips.
Output:negative
Input:Bought these to see if it would help during day with hot flashes. I don’t really feel any menthol or coolness with them but I really do like the wipe, it has a bumpy side that feels really nice on your skin. They would be great for camping though.
Output:positive
Input:I also received spiral curlers even though the listing and all photos show ripple wave curlers. Then a chat rep told me I ordered the wrong ones and sent me an identical link for a new set. I'm so annoyed by this and of course the replacements can't be sent sooner than one week. Doesn't help at all!!
Output:negative
Input:First of all here are some points to put into consideration before buying. This shaver is for...<br />1. Someone who is looking for a TRAVEL shaver that is small and convenient to carry. It comes with a neat carrying case, and only requires two AA batteries that can be found anywhere. One set of batteries can approx. last up to 20 days/shaves-ish. It will still go on, but I can feel the motor running at lower speed.<br />2. Someone who prefers WET shaving experience whenever possible. (Wet shaving with this product is great. Dry, not so much.)<br />3. Someone who needs to shave everyday or simply want that clean shaven look everyday. ( It's still a foil electric shaver, it's fast, efficient, everyday.)<br />4. Someone who needs his travel shaver to have a trimmer. (Frequent long trip? just like me.)<br />5. Someone who doesn't want to spend 15 minutes cleaning the shaver. Who wants hassle-free and easy cleaning shaver.<br /><br />This shaver however isn't for someone who is looking for a blade replacement shaver. I say, wake up, electric shaver will never give you that baby ""skin"" shave like you get from a proper blade shaving method. However, for $15 this shaver can deliver a very decent shave, very close, but definitely not alike. It also isn't quite for someone who plan to use it 7/365 days. You will probably be better off buying other wet/dry panasonic shaver that is rechargable, and have more than one moving blade, linear-super fast motor and on.<br /><br />It's been a year and I still use it on every one of my trip. no problem. Impeccable reliability there, and well made.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />If you decide to buy it, here are my tips and tricks for you. It's based on my experience with it so perhaps it will help you get a better shave with this shaver.<br />1. YES, it will take up to 2-3 weeks if you are coming from blade for your skin to adjust. This is normal and all you need is patience to get through it.<br />2. It's miles apart better wet shaver than dry. DO NOT shave dry unless absolute necessary.<br />3.

Ġlooking,Ġhand,"Input:Just what I was looking for. This mirrow is great for those of us who have aging eyes and need extra light and magnification.
Output:positive
Input:So this is cute- but NOT waterproof! So if you are looking to preserve a hairstyle, don’t count on this!!
Output:negative
Input:Terrible!!!  I applied it several times and it comes out very blotchy after showering.  I washed and scrubbed my hands as well after each application and it still left my hands looking orange.  That is another thing, the color initially goes on looking okay, but after a day it looks orange.  Keep your money and buy a quality product.
Output:negative
Input:I made the mistake of buying 20 bars of this soap, fondly remembering the brand from when Proctor and Gamble sold it. Unilever now owns it and it is dreadful Did anyone ever hear of &#34;seconds&#34; in soap? Well, I got some. I have been through about 6 of these bars, and about halfway though the bar splits, almost in half revealing a dark, unpleasant looking crevice. I have written the people that sold it 3 times, bit no answer. DO NOT buy this product
Output:negative
Input:Decent body wash, not very scented if that is what you are looking for.<br />Would not purchase again
Output:negative
Input:It worked well while it worked; I only had it about 7 months, changed the battery of course and still nothing.  I'm looking for a better one.
Output:negative
Input:I was a little skeptical at first because I couldn't imagine a product at this price doing what it claimed. But after two uses I could clearly see the difference. I am a daily coffee drinker and so you know the effect of that. I am already a few shades lighter and looking forward to continued use
Output:positive
Input:The product itself is great I received it in my Ipsy bag and loved it what’s wrong is that the seller doesn’t seem to check the product before shipping it out I received a dried up full of dried clumps mascara extremely disappointed I was looking forward to this mascara
Output:negative
Input:Let me start.. I found out about this product the day before I purchased. When looking for Guasha I was looking for an affordable price but a good product. I came along this product and feel in love with it at first time. my favorite color is purple so that was a bonus. I decided to purchase it right away and get the fastest shipping so I could try it. once I recieved it I used it right away. it actually works and I can see a difference In my face.it looks more toned and no skin is saggy. I recommend you to buy this product if you are looking for a guasha. this is the one to get! trust me. this is the best. thank you
Output:positive
Input:So this is the first time I have ever ordered hair extensions off Amazon. Back in the day when I got my first set of extensions, you pretty much had to get them through a salon. Amazon just sold books back then.<br /><br />I wanted to try extensions and was excited to see that the cost was fairly reasonable compared to what I was paying 20 some years ago. I thought that the first ones I had were more expensive since they were through the salon and salon has overhead costs, have to pay the stylist etc.<br /><br />That last statement is only halfway true. There is something to be said for the quality of these extensions as well. At first, out of the box they seem awesome. The color matched amazingly well considering I chose it off the internet. The extensions were shiny, soft, and definitely seemed like human hair. I would braid them at night and take out braids the next day which left a nice wave that matched the texture of my natural hair. I washed them twice a week and used a leave in conditioner. I would also use dry shampoo throughout the week to keep them looking good. Here comes the not so great news...<br /><br /> I am writing this evaluation after 6 weeks of wear. I would say that these are fine for about 3 weeks, if you don't wash them all the time, keep them braided, brushed etc. After 3 weeks - well.. I hope you like braids!<br /><br />So at the 3-4 week period the extensions begin to get very frizzy and dry. They will start to hang in strips or chunks. It becomes extremely difficult to run your fingers through them regardless of how much you brush. Even after braiding them at night, they no longer wave. It's extremely noticeable now because my natural hair does have a wave to it. They are like long strips of frizz or maybe carded sheep's wool (if any of you are familiar with sheep?!). I always kept the ends conditioned throughout the day because I was concerned about ratty ends. Well I could add a gallon of conditioner now and it would make no difference really. They just look bad and they look a bit better if I trim it up but then it's only a few days before they're back to being ratty.<br /><br />So this may sound like a no brainer but you definitely get what you pay for with hair extensions and if you want to know the details as to why there are many videos on YouTube that explain the processes hair goes through before its boxed up and sold to you.<br /><br />I love the way my hair looked more longer and fuller so next time I will just save up for better quality. Really, in the long run, if you decide you want to keep wearing hair extensions, it's going to cost you more money to buy cheap ones all the time then it would to just invest in a quality set of them.<br /><br />Lastly I'd like to share my opinion on YouTube and other reviews you find on the internet. There are many reviews out there saying these are great. I've decided that either they are reviewing these right after installation and yes they really are great then. Or, they are being paid by the extension company to say positive things or at least not be totally negative and tell you all this bad stuff about a product.<br /><br />I should have stuck by the old ""you get what you pay for"". However, I didn't know if I'd want to do this long term, I figured prices may be lower buying from Amazon vs Salon and it has been 15 or 20 years since I had extensions. They seem more popular now so maybe the price has gone down.<br /><br />No. No. No. No. None of those assumptions were correct. Quality is definitely reflected in the price so just keep that in mind if you do decide to go with these. Or maybe just imagine how good you'd look with dreadlocks and try that towards the end of their frizzy little life? That's kind of what I ended up doing. I just do a bunch of long braids put em in a ponytail and wah lah now I'm boho, right?
Output:negative
Input:It took a much longer time than expected to get here. The charm is shown in the picture to be attached to the metal piece on the hairband. But, when I opened the package it was loose and hanging from the hair tie itself. It's a sturdy feeling metal though, the fact that it wasn't attached properly to begin with makes me worry about future purchases with similar products. Because, other sellers have pictures with it intact and looking very cute. :c
Output:negative
Input:Didn’t stick to my eyelid and was really unnatural looking and wish I hadn’t gotten them.
Output:negative
Input:These are supposed to help push your cuticles back but didn't work for me.  I ended up having to buy a different product to achieve the results I was looking for.
Output:negative
Input:Cheap and tacky looking and the packaging flattens the lashes
Output:negative
Input:The hair is soft and lightweight for sure but the twists unravel quickly and get tangled so fast. The color is also not as described. It’s more like a 4 than a 1B ombré. So I’m walking around looking crazy as hell because I started my hair already and didn’t realize how light it was till I installed. So...buy with caution.

Ġeverything,Ġafter,"Input:In the age of c-19, I added this to my club kit for doing my back/shoulders after a workout at the club.  I can barely make it work and it takes a bit of contorting to do it because it's just about four or maybe five inches too short to use comfortably.  I have several silicon scrubbers around the house and one in my kit for washing most everything and me and the wife really like them.  I got the back scrubber -- well, for obvious reasons -- but found it is a routine annoyance to use because it is so short.  What I can get to, it works well for so that why the limited star reduction on this review but I'd sooner replace it with something built for my size.

Input:I saw the reviews that said it doesn't do anything, but I was hoping it was more subjective and maybe it might work for me. Nope, it really doesn't brush anything.<br /><br />- Bristles are weak, arrived bent<br />-Maaaaybe could work if you have super thin hair<br />- Thin and flimsy feeling if that's a concern<br /><br />I use ""wet"" hairbrushes that are designed like this, and I have to say that the quality really varies. I have a couple that I love and work wonderfully--brushes tangled wet hair painlessly, evenly brushes hair to tie it up. I've only tried 4 brands, but this is the worst I've seen. The bristles are weak--they're really thin, even for wet brushes, and they arrived bent (not because it was used--it was in the plastic wrap and everything). I do have thick hair, but this is the first brush I've used (of ANY kind--tiny travel ones included) that feels like it's literally going on top of my hair and not through it at all, even when I try to press down. It maaay work if you have thin hair, but I mean really thin hair, and even them I'm doubtful.<br /><br />I bought this hoping I could use it as a travel brush, so I wasn't too picky as long as it brushed relatively okay. Obviously not, but the plastic is also lighter and thinner than I expected it to be, again, even for a small travel brush, so I'm doubtful it or the hinge wouldn't break easily with pressure while trying to brush thick or tangly hair.
Output:negative
Input:I have tried several of these over the past few months and while this is easily the best one, I personally don't think it is worth the 3 bills they are asking.<br /><br />the retail packaging on this is fantastic and the hard shell box it comes in is a big bonus, but as far as the device itself it seems to be on par with some half this price. I personally would rather received it in a plain box to save a little money. The one little thing that Is super convenient that stands out is this has the proper size cable ties already on it and they're not Velcro! They are button snaps and that is a great thing because the Velcro ties get full of hair and fuzz.<br /><br />And Like similar devices with the the cold touch thing it is a little weird the first time you feel it. because you think it feels warm but it's not, it just messes with your head a bit. And so far with this feature you can't really feel this one doing anything until you get a little overlap in the same session. So that is nice.<br /><br />And with this one I have noticed some results.<br />I have been testing these on different small sections of my leg in the same area trying to get a consistent controlled test and I'm keeping track of how long it takes. I'm a big Burley guy so there's no shortage of hair on my legs. lol<br />So with this one after about 4 weeks using it twice a week I do see the hair thinning out a bit. But a couple devices half this price did the same thing. And it is definitely heating the hair. To make sure I tried it on an unshaved area and it definitely stings a little as the fully exposed hairs heat up. But, a couple others did this as well.<br /><br />So is it worth it for you? Maybe. if you want a premium feel and look with everything like you bought it at Neiman Marcus, buy this one.<br />But if you just want hair removal and don't care about the packaging there are cheaper options available.

Ġcurl,Ġsmell,"Input:This was fantastic. I love that it's soft so I can push it onto the deeper layers of my hair to get in and dry that section well. The size is nice and big and dried my thick, curly hair in about 20 minutes. I had so much curl definition and volume that lasted for days. This was an awesome investment.
Output:positive
Input:Didn't like it at all. I was so excited to try it. It is heavy and didn't lengthen or curl my lashes. Took awhile to take it off compared to my other waterproof mascaras.
Output:negative
Input:Very very frizzy! The curl pattern is nice, but you can barely see it through all the the frizz. Texture is pretty soft and rather shiny unlike the Jamaican bounce at the beauty supply stores.
Output:negative
Input:Love what this product did to my hair! It's amazing! I hadn't seen my hair curl like this in years. Just ordered another one!
Output:positive
Input:I have long hair with an unruly curl to it. This dryer/ straightener combo is by far the best product I have used. It saves so much time on drying and leaves a nice smooth “just walked out of the salon” finish to it. Highly recommend!
Output:positive
Input:I absolutely love this curling iron. I am 46 and have not curled my hair since high school so needless to say I am not a professional. After trying and returning several others, I found this one that gives the wavey curls exactly how I've wanted and with ease.  Great purchase and price!
Output:positive
Input:If you want nice looking curls don't bother with these. I like that they includes a lot of curlers compared to some products that only give you like 4 of them, but these curls looked absolutely awful. Think like misshapen Shirley temple curls, do not bother with this product!
Output:negative
Input:Large so if you have a lot of make up works great plus there's room in the bottom for your curling iron straightener its worth the price Plus you can detach the top box if you don't need to take the whole thing with you
Output:positive
Input:Only lasted for 2 weeks didn't curl at all even with low setting don't know if I had a fault batch but I won't be buying this again I've had unprocessed virgin hair before and this ain't it
Output:negative
Input:When I first received the hair I knew immediately that it was not the color advertised. It was in the lighter brown family and definitely not black. However, I felt the curl pattern and texture looked good enough so I kept it. Whoa! It looks the part until water hits it then you look like a pet with the mange. 😐Very disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:This hair is a good color and that’s the only thing that’s good. It sheds daily poor quality don’t curl well will never wast my money on this hair again
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited when I grabbed a discount on this item.I have been doing a lot of reading about how important eyelash curlers are in a beauty routine.I could not wait to see if it was true and immediately opened it up and gave it a try.YES it does make a HUGE difference and my eyes really popped after curling prior to applying my mascara.I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone in the market for one.
Output:positive
Input:My best friend got me this for my birthday and it is such a great tool to curl your hair. Very easy to learn and use. the extra pieces can help create different waves. I cant believe how much Ill saves by using this curling wand than visiting the salon. Will recommend this to anyone with long hair.<br />Ill be buying one for my mother as well.
Output:positive
Input:Hard case for Revlon One-step styling tool is a perfect fit.<br />I can see using this case for any curling iron, flat iron, or styling wand fitting dimensions of case. Hard case makes it perfect for travel and storage!
Output:positive
Input:Its a sturdy eyelash curler, but honestly it doesn't curl very well. I find myself having to squeeze the curler extremely hard to get a little lift. Once I add mascara the curl falls.

Ġthese,Ġuses,"Input:I bought these for a kids pool party, was really awesome and fun, and washed right off with soap and water!
Output:positive
Input:I purchase 5 bags of these (for a total of 25) and while 4 arrived with 5 masks each, one only had 4 masks. I’m now short one mask and don’t have enough time to get a replacement before the bridal shower. I hope they expedite ship me one green sequin mask to make up for this shortcoming. That’s all I’m missing. Otherwise these look super cute!
Output:negative
Input:These actually are pretty big! If you have thick hair I 10/10 recommend these (the 2 toned ones). Other colors are also great too! Got them as well. Came excatly as expected and great customer service! Also LOVE the colors! Will definitely be buying more in the future!
Output:positive
Input:I am very, very disappointed with  this product.  I purchased it for my liquid hair spray.  I wanted a gentle soft spray, but I got a straight spray.  When I tried it with water, the spray was different - soft and even (which is what I wanted).  I would like to return these.
Output:negative
Input:I purchased these in the hopes of having some cool color shifting shadows. After swiping the color, there was a clear gel under the first layer of shadow. There is an EXTREMELY thin layer of colorshifting creme followed by 99% of the rest of the color appearing as if it was vaseline. I mixed the shadow up in the container and now the color is completely transparent and unusable unless you want to feel like you put vaseline on your eyelid. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
Output:negative
Input:I use these after climbing in order to increase blood flow to my fingers in hopes of reducing joint or tendon pain and they do work well for that. From how I understand these work, they will only relieve pain if you want more blood to flow to the area since the pressure and movement are stimulating the tissue. These don't help the knuckle as it is not a part of the thin finger but the DIP and PIP joints are greatly relaxed. I describe the sensation similar to the prongs of a fork being rolled across a finger without the fork being pushed hard into the skin. It could also be described as rubbing a ball of Christmas lights across a hand.<br />For the price these are reasonable quality justifying the loss one stars. They all appeared intact when they arrived however the first one I used broke immediately. A short time later a second ring broke after only being used twice. I wound not say that I stretched them beyond their limits as my fingers are quite small. The rings are somewhat made of coils of wire and could be somewhat pieced back together for further use though this takes additional effort. I was able to contact the company and they gave me a full refund so five stars for their customer support.
Output:positive
Input:Thats all these are is blown up hype, dont fall for it. The nose/ear trimmers just dont work, the lawn mower works ok but ok is not what I paid for. For famn near $100 I want damn good and this falls short.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMEND USE IN THE SHOWER
Output:negative
Input:Best tweezers I haves ever used.  Gets those tiny hairs you can’t see but you can feel them.  I have two pairs.  Have to hide them from my BF.  Will always have a pair of these.

Input:Bought two of these in 2007 after using rechargeable Sonicares for years. Prefer the replaceable batteries and they are both working fine after four years. Much easier for travel. Less space required at home.
Output:positive
Input:I was excited to find these. I keep my makeup brushes on my bathroom counter and while I am good about cleaning them, I know they are exposed to a lot of dust and germs, so I was hoping that these covers would be a good solution to keep them nice. I was wrong.<br /><br />Let's start with the three large heads. I was happy to find that these were three different sizes as the main brushes I use have different volumes of bristles. I put them on based on the size of brush and cap. There was no other way to possibly get them onto the brush rather than stick down the heard pull it through until the heart was around the bristles. The silicone was so difficult to slide up my brush handle that I was scared of ripping them and my brush handles are not that thick. Once they were in place I came across my next problem, how to gain access to the brush without fully removing the silicone cover. I somewhat figured out how to use the top hole to flip the cover inside out and expose the bristles, the problem was that in doing so many of the bristles got stuck or were pulled in the wrong direction. I have expensive brushes and I take care of them. I do not want them damaged by a cheap piece of silicone. I tried my best to keep them neat, but after about three days of doing this, the first of the three silicone covers began to rip from this practice. I'm not sure what else I was supposed to do to access my brush. I ended up taking the covers off all three and will maybe use them for traveling, but that's it. They are impractical for day to day use.<br /><br />No to the small ones. These are just annoying. They are all so tiny and all the same size. I have whole bunch of different sized eye shadow brushes and only one or two and the right sized head to fit in these, which makes them mostly useless for me. I don't get the appeal of the suction cup. The pictures show people sticking them to the bathroom mirror, but once the brush is taken out of the cap and the cap remains on the mirror they are going to be impossible to place back in the cover without taking it off the mirror. Additionally the hole to stick the brushes in the caps is so small that the brush bristles were being bent.

Input:Nice quality but these bundles were not enough to cover my head even with leaving half my hair out at the top. Disappointed but I used my skills and emprovised for the night... made a cute ponytail with it the next day, since that’s all you can do with it
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:fe99bb65fff59658786c0fadb5ee36c7]] These were absolutely beautiful I ordered them for my baby shower I was nervous ordering online but these were perfect they look very natural light weight zero complaints as you can see from the video. Will definitely order again and you get three for that price you really can’t beat that
Output:positive
Input:Omg y’all this hair is thin and the bundles are very small! Can’t even wear hair straight you have to keep some type of volume in it to look presentable. Honestly to do a whole head with these bundles you need like 5.
Output:negative
Input:Love these, I have bought several for added thickness.
Output:positive
Input:poor quality. Some of sheets identical. I have bought other stencils that are good, but these I wouldn't ever by again.
Output:negative
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I bought these for a kids pool party, was really awesome and fun, and washed right off with soap and water!
Output:positive
Input:I purchase 5 bags of these (for a total of 25) and while 4 arrived with 5 masks each, one only had 4 masks. I’m now short one mask and don’t have enough time to get a replacement before the bridal shower. I hope they expedite ship me one green sequin mask to make up for this shortcoming. That’s all I’m missing. Otherwise these look super cute!
Output:negative
Input:These actually are pretty big! If you have thick hair I 10/10 recommend these (the 2 toned ones). Other colors are also great too! Got them as well. Came excatly as expected and great customer service! Also LOVE the colors! Will definitely be buying more in the future!
Output:positive
Input:I am very, very disappointed with  this product.  I purchased it for my liquid hair spray.  I wanted a gentle soft spray, but I got a straight spray.  When I tried it with water, the spray was different - soft and even (which is what I wanted).  I would like to return these.
Output:negative
Input:I purchased these in the hopes of having some cool color shifting shadows. After swiping the color, there was a clear gel under the first layer of shadow. There is an EXTREMELY thin layer of colorshifting creme followed by 99% of the rest of the color appearing as if it was vaseline. I mixed the shadow up in the container and now the color is completely transparent and unusable unless you want to feel like you put vaseline on your eyelid. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
Output:negative
Input:I use these after climbing in order to increase blood flow to my fingers in hopes of reducing joint or tendon pain and they do work well for that. From how I understand these work, they will only relieve pain if you want more blood to flow to the area since the pressure and movement are stimulating the tissue. These don't help the knuckle as it is not a part of the thin finger but the DIP and PIP joints are greatly relaxed. I describe the sensation similar to the prongs of a fork being rolled across a finger without the fork being pushed hard into the skin. It could also be described as rubbing a ball of Christmas lights across a hand.<br />For the price these are reasonable quality justifying the loss one stars. They all appeared intact when they arrived however the first one I used broke immediately. A short time later a second ring broke after only being used twice. I wound not say that I stretched them beyond their limits as my fingers are quite small. The rings are somewhat made of coils of wire and could be somewhat pieced back together for further use though this takes additional effort. I was able to contact the company and they gave me a full refund so five stars for their customer support.
Output:positive
Input:Thats all these are is blown up hype, dont fall for it. The nose/ear trimmers just dont work, the lawn mower works ok but ok is not what I paid for. For famn near $100 I want damn good and this falls short.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMEND USE IN THE SHOWER
Output:negative
Input:Best tweezers I haves ever used.  Gets those tiny hairs you can’t see but you can feel them.  I have two pairs.  Have to hide them from my BF.  Will always have a pair of these.
Output:positive
Input:Bought two of these in 2007 after using rechargeable Sonicares for years. Prefer the replaceable batteries and they are both working fine after four years. Much easier for travel. Less space required at home.
Output:positive
Input:I was excited to find these. I keep my makeup brushes on my bathroom counter and while I am good about cleaning them, I know they are exposed to a lot of dust and germs, so I was hoping that these covers would be a good solution to keep them nice. I was wrong.<br /><br />Let's start with the three large heads. I was happy to find that these were three different sizes as the main brushes I use have different volumes of bristles. I put them on based on the size of brush and cap. There was no other way to possibly get them onto the brush rather than stick down the heard pull it through until the heart was around the bristles. The silicone was so difficult to slide up my brush handle that I was scared of ripping them and my brush handles are not that thick. Once they were in place I came across my next problem, how to gain access to the brush without fully removing the silicone cover. I somewhat figured out how to use the top hole to flip the cover inside out and expose the bristles, the problem was that in doing so many of the bristles got stuck or were pulled in the wrong direction. I have expensive brushes and I take care of them. I do not want them damaged by a cheap piece of silicone. I tried my best to keep them neat, but after about three days of doing this, the first of the three silicone covers began to rip from this practice. I'm not sure what else I was supposed to do to access my brush. I ended up taking the covers off all three and will maybe use them for traveling, but that's it. They are impractical for day to day use.<br /><br />No to the small ones. These are just annoying. They are all so tiny and all the same size. I have whole bunch of different sized eye shadow brushes and only one or two and the right sized head to fit in these, which makes them mostly useless for me. I don't get the appeal of the suction cup. The pictures show people sticking them to the bathroom mirror, but once the brush is taken out of the cap and the cap remains on the mirror they are going to be impossible to place back in the cover without taking it off the mirror. Additionally the hole to stick the brushes in the caps is so small that the brush bristles were being bent. Again I'm not going to ruin my brushes that cost several times what the covers cost to keep these annoying caps on them.<br /><br />The only reason this set is not getting one star from me is that I can use the large ones when traveling to keep my brushes nice in my makeup bag, but otherwise this set is completely useless.

Ġamount,Ġdue,"Input:Upon application it runs immediately causing all these small lines. Also Waterproof is an understatement, it was nearly impossible to get off. I had to go through about 8 make up wipes to get it /mostly/ off. it still left horrible raccoon eyes that no amount of cleaner could remove, just black stains around my eyes.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve tried a fair amount of products and this one works the best for me. It doesn’t clump, doesn’t get sticky, doesn’t harden, and doesn’t make my hair shiny or greasy looking. It takes a very small amount to be effective, and it simply makes my otherwise unruly thick hair moldable and stylable. I really like the subtle fragrance too. The downside is that it’s usually out of stock and I can’t depend on it being available.
Output:positive
Input:I was expecting my lashes to get a little longer, but I have never seen a small amount of added length. I would defiantly not waste my money, or time  on the expectation of this product working, if I had it to do over. I wish I knew of product that worked like it said it would. I would not suggest anyone buy this product.
Output:negative
Input:I recently had to get my long hair cut short for an arm surgery.  I knew that I would not be able to do anything with my hair for a few months.  I picked this product up and it works amazingly well with just a one handed blow dry.  Just ordered my second tube.  A small amount provides body and smooths frizz.  Love it!
Output:positive

Output:negative
Input:First off, I sweat so bad that I don’t look like I’m wearing any makeup by the time I leave my home, and in the summertime, it feels like I’m sitting in a jacuzzi with my clothes on… So, it was really important for this stuff to work. Unfortunately, this antiperspirant smells like a combination of formaldehyde and a meth lab … and I know because I tried using this stuff on my face to treat excessive sweating (due to fibromyalgia), but it only kind of worked for a 1 or 2 days, but not in a row. So it’s not reliable. Plus, it leaves your skin dry and terribly itchy!<br />Which REALLY SUCKS, considering how expensive it is for such a small amount of “antiperspirant”.<br /><br />In short, I don’t recommend it.
Output:negative
Input:Amazing on thin or straight hair. Not sticky, easy to use, pleasantly light scented, lightweight and you can apply it after hairspray to avoid helmet hair and add a perfect amount of texture. Doesn't gunk up after a few days of no washing. I do wish it was a little less expensive though. But yet an amazing product.
Output:positive
Input:Everything about this scrubber is awesome!!! Lathers great, rinses great and gives you the right amount of scrub. Great product. Highly recommend.
Output:positive
Input:Initially bought this product because it claimed to be 100% Aloe Vera. After receiving the product, we immediately noticed the fragrance. We tried a small amount on our hand and it was very cool to the touch. It dissipates quickly into your skin and doesn’t feel like aloe but instead like hand sanitizer. I turned over to see the ingredients and, sure enough, this product is not 100% Aloe Vera. Given the fragrance and texture, I wouldn’t be surprised if it were hand sanitizer.

Output:positive
Input:Barely works. And they only provide a tiny amount of the liquid liner.
Output:negative
Input:Didn’t match my hair color and was too expensive for the amount of hair
Output:negative
Input:Wow. I’m a huge skeptic on “natural remedies” and expensive nail polishes like this one. I’ve been using this in combination with “Pale Peach” which is from the same brand. I’ve been battling a nail fungal infection for a long time and my oral meds have been working very slowly. No topical medications have stopped it. I wanted to try this because I just wanted to cover the darn nail! One day I decided to take off the polish to see if there was any improvement and BAM! My nail looked stronger than ever before and the yellowness was far less noticeable.<br />Pro tip: File most of the dead and lifted nail off before applying. This helps the product penetrate deeper if youre fighting fungus.<br />PS. This nail looks like gel when its dry and lasts a great amount of time.
Output:positive
Input:I absolutely love it! It is a little bit hard to use the very first time. Just have to be careful with the amount being applied, I recommend using an angel eyebrow brush and start with a light hand that way you can build up the perfect eyebrow 😀. I live in a part of Texas where it can get very hot and HUMID during summer...im talking about 90 degrees + and 76% humidity....with that said I need something that wont smear off when i go outside and this product will work!
Output:positive
Input:I purchased several items from this line and am just so shocked at the amount of chemicals in them. The way the description makes it sound is that it's a nice natural product... but instead it's natural ingredients are low on the list.

Ġthings,Ġto,"Input:My wife doesn’t like my naturally gray eyebrows. I don’t like it when she dyes them a dark brown / black. I get Groucho Marx brows when they are too dark. I’m a guy and I refuse to go to the “salon”. Happy wife = happy life, so I decided to take things into my own hands and do it myself. Did lots of reading and figured why not try this. Better yet, let’s see if a guy who has never applied eyebrow dye could do it. I figured since I can fix most things at the house why not? So, a couple of weeks ago I mixed up a capsule and applied it with the brush. I tried not to get any on my skin, but it was impossible. I let the dye cook for a couple of minutes and the thoroughly washed it off. It also easily came off my skin. Some of the gray hairs didn’t quite take, but the brows look completely natural. Even my adult daughter and wife were shocked at how good they looked. It’s been full on summer here and hot every day. I’ve worked out every day since applying the dye and then showering and with all of that, the brows still look great. I think it’s a bit funny that I can’t live with Santa brows, but the wife is happy, so what the heck!

Input:from the time I was a teenager (i'm 57 now) I had a terrible foot oder that I could not get rid of.  Even a visit to a deremtologist didn't help.  The oder was so bad it was embarassing to remove my shoes.  The skin on the bottom of my feet look like swiss cheese.  About 9 years or so ago I ran across this product.  Simply put, it is amazing.  Apparently the oder issue and the skin issue was due to my feet perspiring excessively.  Once I starting using Onox things changed.  Over a period of a couple months it completely removed the &#34;swiss cheese&#34; skin and now I have absolutely no foot oder.  I can wear a pair of shoes or boots for a full day and when I remove them there is zero oder from my feet.  And now the skin on the bottom of my feet looks completely normal.  For me this product was a Godsend!
Output:positive
Input:I haven't found that my head is too big for most things, but it is for this.  it doesn't fit at all.
Output:negative
Input:I used this in Iceland and Scotland and it worked like a champ. It doesn't have a switch, like most things do, to go from 110 to 240v so I was a little nervous but it worked just fine. This is a travel size curling iron so it won't be as big or as perfect as a regular size professional iron but it worked pretty good and got me very close to what I usually get out of a curling iron. I have long, medium thick hair and had no problems. The clamp isn't as tight as it could be, my only complaint, but it still worked great and heats very well. It's compact with about a 1&#34; barrel. Again, this is for travel so don't expect all the function and features of a full size curling iron but if you travel light it will be perfect.
Output:positive
Input:Wtfffff!!! These things bleeed allll overrrr my sheeeets! I'm sooo mad! And my sheets are not cheap! Luckily they were white I tried bleaching it out. But it was still there!!!!! Soo what kinda die y'all use. I'm sure if your hair is blond you're gonna wake up with blue hair! I want my money backkkk.
Output:negative
Input:I first used this one time about 2 months ago. I left it on most of the day, but my scalp itched the entire time. I didn't notice any benefit from using it, and I sure wasn't in a hurry to try it again.<br />Fast forward two months, and I applied it again yesterday after a shower. I've had it on all night as I've been on the computer and doing things around the house, and again my scalp has been itching like crazy. I've kept a towel handy to wipe my the oil off my fingers every time I scratch my scalp, and I've made many trips to the bathroom to get a comb to thoroughly scratch with. Ahhhhhh...relief (for a few seconds).<br /><br />I've had it on about 10 hours now, and I'm heading in to wash it out. I'll never use it again.
Output:negative
Input:I care for my adult, mentally challenged sister, and these toothbrushes have been a God send. Teeth brushing is not one of her favorite things to do, but with this toothbrush, the task has been made okay by her. She willingly lets me brush her teeth now instead of fighting it. Thank you!
Output:positive
Input:Amazon I can't say enough good things about the products and serices you offer and this razor was one of them. I can't begin to say how great I think this razor is.  This is the best Norleco I have ever owned.  I have been an electric razor shaver for 35 years and this is by far the best I have ever owned.  Oh by the way all of them were Norleco's.  Close shave, comfortable.  Fantastic.
Output:positive
Input:You get many beautiful colors, and they fit perfect not too long or not too small. You do have to be careful though because they will get stuck on some things. The one downfall I had is that maybe around 6 of the piercings, the little diamond was not glued right in the middle but a little off to the side.
Output:positive
Input:I’ve only just started using these, but the price was right, they are effective at removing makeup & dirt, they are refreshing, and I have had no adverse reactions to them.  I will update as I continue using them should anything change.<br />UPDATE: 3 days later my near-perfect skin is COMPLETELY broken out in tiny pimples everywhere!  Of course not everyone’s is sensitive to the same things, but this is really awful!  Now I’m stuck with 5 packs of them unless the seller will do the right thing and let me return the unopened ones.
Output:negative
Input:Guys, these things are so pretty and do not come off while I sleep. I woke up impressed because all my previous headwear also slipped off. Plus the dye didn’t stain my white pillow case.
Output:positive
Input:These things are huge lol. I've asked sooo many friends if I can size these next to their brows.. and maybe 2 out of 30 even have brows big enough for these. They're very cool. And there are plenty of options to choose from. But good luck getting these to be an average size.
Output:negative
Input:I thought these would be like all the other black silicone rubber bands out there, but these things are just too big. They say they are for baby girls, but these are too big to be useful. I was very disappointed when these came in.
Output:negative
Input:Super small…you get what you pay for. Very cheap product, to the point where it really isn’t usable. When I opened the box, everything was covered in powder…some things were opened and spilled, and absolutely STUNK like monomer.
Output:negative
Input:I am honestly impressed with this product. I've tried a few different things and nothing. Not only does it smell good, it sticks good as well. Totally loving it.
Output:positive

Ġoff,Ġbroken,"Input:It looks like there are only 2 pairs, a top and a bottom.  However come to find out that each cell contained both the upper and lower lash.  It’s certainly not obvious when taking them off each cell (packaging).  So I thought I only got 2 pair and had much difficulty removing them from the packaging without them being stretched cause the self-adhesive makes it almost impossible to remove them.

The moment we show it off everyone needs to check it out closer.<br /><br />The case comes rolled up and when you unroll you will find 24 various make-up brushes each with it's plastic sleeve to protect the bristles and keep them from getting squished during shipping.<br /><br />The brushes are all in various sizes and shapes and all have various uses. There are angled brushes, foundation brushes, a mascara brush, fan brushes, eye liner brushes, blush brushes, eye brown brushes, and shadow brushes and more.<br /><br />This is an amazing price for this set. Any girl or &#34;guy&#34; will love them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.

Input:For the most part these lashes are pretty great, especially for the price. They look great on, they stay on, and they’re not difficult to apply. Honestly will probably never switch back to regular glue on lashes. I’ve tried different magnetic lashes and these are by far my favorite. The little magnets haven’t broken off and I’ve been able to rewear them quite a bit. Only problems I had with these is the glue is a pain to take off, and is super sticky if you get it on your tweezers. Same thing if you get the glue in the lashes, it takes a bit to clean it out. If this happens , do not try wiping it out of the lashes while it’s still wet. It makes it worse lol. As for taking the liner off , It will ball up and smear across your skin. I guess it’s not THAT big of a deal as long as you have a good makeup remover and patience. But just a heads up that it takes some work to get off. But on the bright side, that just means they hold up well and will stay on throughout your time wearing them! Don’t let my cautions daunt you from buying them! They really are great lashes and they’re a great addition to any makeup look. :)

Input:This product is so easy to use, I’ve only done it once so far with regular gel. It definitely doesn’t just bubble right off like the image shows, but after scuffing and putting a layer on it did start to at least bible in a spot or two and with light scrapping came off fairly quickly with out as much damage as would normally occur when removing gel. It doesn’t really have an  odor  which is nice and it is thick so it goes just in the mail and does not touch my skin. I put hard gel on this time I will update and describe how it worked with hard gel. I gave it 4 stars because there was still some effort involved, but I do recommend.

Input:Cheap wig. Received unit was frizzy and tracks hanging off wig. Headband and elastic way to big. Velcro on headband not sticky. Color not like pictured, whole lot of blonde hair in large segments mixed into the black hair. Not blended well. Looks fake. Don’t waste your money, Unless you want it for a costume or something. I would say you get what you pay for but this wig doesn’t even give you that.

Input:Okay let’s start by saying human hair lace front wigs for under $200 are rare. Good ones are almost impossible to find. This one is well worth the money. I ordered the 18” and when I received it (prime 2 days) it looked like a hot mess. Yellow, body wave soft but messy. I colored it with medium ash blond and light ash blond box color. It took the ash color too well! I went back and redid it in pale beige blond and lightened it up. I still need to do platinum highlights and a shadow root. I conditioned, blow dried and straightened with a flat iron. It straightened absolutely beautifully. I cut off about 3” because sadly the ends were too thin. The hair is gorgeous though. I curl it with a 1 1/4” curling iron and it looks great at first but curl doesn’t stay well in humidity. It remains soft smooth and silky though. Now the cap-lace front appears pretty much preplucked. I plucked my part. I did not pluck the edges as they were great as is. Lace melted into my hairline. Cap is comfortable and wefts do not show. Good natural density. My one issue:: this cap is BIG. That’s perfect if you have a bigger head or tons of bio hair but I don’t. I’m a petite average and the bigger circumference on this wig makes it difficult to lay the lace without overlap and buckling. Also the cap itself is a little baggy on me. I make it work but I could never wear it without a wig grip underneath and it’s still biggish. Overall though a great wig for the price!!

Ġbrands,Ġhad,"Input:I have used Norelco razors for over 40 years, and have always sworn by them. My father and both grandfathers used them--and now, my son. However, I am now looking at other brands for the first time ever. I have had three SpeedXL models in the past year--and all have had the on/off switch go bad within a few months. One of the razors was replaced by Norelco--but I am tired of the hassle of undependable razors! The last one woke us up in the middle of the night when it turned on by itself. The razors do give a very nice shave--they just do not last very long.
Output:negative
Input:Best hairspray I've ever used at any price point!  Hair is not like a ""helmet"" yet holds the style great.  Brushes out easily and does not cause your hair to be ""dirty"" with hairspray.  In addition, you're not spraying the entire bathroom with hairspray since one can easily direct the spray where you want it with no ""over spray"" like ""canned"" hair sprays.  You also don't need a ""gas mask"" when you use it.  Has a great subtle fragrance that won't compete with any other fragrance you might be wearing.  Would recommend to anyone other all other brands available.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product since it appears that no other store/sales enterprise wishes to sell it!
Output:positive
Input:These do not stay on your nails! Soon after I put them on they would come off by doing normal things.  Sad part is I would look down and notice one missing and wondered ""where is it"" like the lost sock in the laundry its unknown where the nail adhesives ended up.  I've used other brands and never had a problem, they stayed on until I took them off.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve used many brands of nail strips with much success. NOT THESE. The adhesion didn’t last more than 2 hours. Other brands lasted me weeks. These unfortunately are going in the trash. Do not buy.
Output:negative
Input:I've been wearing extensions for over 15 years- clip ins, tapes, Great Lengths, you name it. I've tried many different brands. I was very excited to try these- based on the reviews and the price. Let me tell you- save your $$.  I purchased on the Canadian site where you can see my verified review but wanted to leave this here also to save other people from my misfortune.<br /><br />When they arrived, the hair looked beautiful. It was healthy and shiny looking. I ordered 4 bundles- 16inch, 18inch and 2 packs of 20inch. The 20inches were tied too tight on the tape bonds when they arrived- it left a funny wavy dent that made it impossible to seal properly during installation. Fortunately, it wasn't all of them, but quite a few were un-usable. They were also very thin at the ends, like other reviews stated, and had to be trimmed an inch or two off the bottom to make it look decent.<br /><br />I had an important event coming up and had already booked my appointment to have them professionally installed, so I just cut my losses and ordered another pack of 16inch to make up the difference. So I bought 5 packs in total. All in colour 8/60.<br /><br />When I first had them installed, they looked great. Up until the first wash... I have now had them in for 2 weeks- I just washed them for the 3rd time last night. I know how to care for extensions- I sleep with a silk scarf over them after putting into a loose braid, use only the highest quality products, deep condition below the bond for minimum 30 min after each wash, use minimal heat, and use a good heat protector when I do. After only TWO WEEKS- the hair is garbage (see photo) I will have to take them out. The photo is AFTER I attempted to smooth them out and cut off another inch. They are full of split ends, and look disgusting. I'm wondering if these are even real hair at this point. They feel and look like cheap doll hair.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the other reviews were either written directly after install and not after washing or wearing for even a few days- or if I got a bad batch??  Maybe the darker colours are better. I don't know. All I know is I'm super disappointed and out of pocket over $500 after install.  The only good thing I can say is that the tape itself is strong and stayed in.
Output:negative
Input:Pros:<br /><br />1.  Good shave, after break in period.  Not the best I've had for my skin/beard type.  Several passes were needed for my beard which is course.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  Like other users' complaints about the hinge design, the flip up mechanism is highly fragile.  I wish I sent it back to Norelco, instead I threw into the trash can I was so angry!  Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk!<br /><br />2.  The Cool Skin additive is not worth it.  Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl's and get more for your money and better product.  It's delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads.<br /><br />3.  The trimmer is a hassle to put on if you're looking for a speedy morning shave. Other brands/models have a flip up design, which I thought every shaver had.<br /><br />Good luck.
Output:negative
Input:You can find other brands that work better. Not work the money
Output:negative
Input:Package came right on time.  I've been using a product that I buy from my local beauty supply store and I have been unhappy with it, as it always lifts.  I've tried other brands and was never happy with them.  My nails never came out like at the salon.  I decided to try this product out and I am so happy with it.  I absolutely love it!  I was very impressed and also surprised at how well this product works.  I will recommend this products to my friends =)
Output:positive
Input:I travel 50% of the time and love these for air travel and for the hotel.  They are soft and very dark.  I have tried many brands and find these the best.<br />Like all eye masks, you will get lines sometimes on your face if you sleep on your side.
Output:positive
Input:I bought two different brands of face paint pallets that were same price. This one came with some cracks in the paint cakes and some chunks floating around in the containers, not too big of deal I guess. But when using the paint, yikes, not good. They were not very opaque. Had a hard time getting them to apply in a decent fashion. This one definitely lost over the other pallet. The plus side is, it does come with some sticker stencils, and a pack of wipes and paint brushes. For it being so cheap, that does help make up a little bit for the quality. I would not but this one again though.
Output:negative
Input:I've had this soap for a little over a month now and I really wanted to love this brand, but honestly I don't. It is very &#34;dry&#34; and coarse. It crumbles very easily and actually scratches my skin if I'm not careful. It also has a lot of white marks all through the bar which seems to be from it being charred or burnt. There is also a strong &#34;burnt&#34; smell to the bar too. I get that there may be some ash from the way black soap is made, but the bar I received is just not the quality I've experienced with other brands.
Output:negative
Input:Let me first start by saying I never write reviews of products. I love this product. It is very soothing and seems to have a sortof plumping effect. I have VERY sensitive skin. Pretty much breaks out at the site of skincare products. I have tried everything from Cr&egrave;me De La Mer to drugstore brands and I love this brand!! I wish I had know about it during my 3 pregnancies when my skin was a disaster!  And every time I order and they send a sample I get hooked on a new product. Good thing is the products are reasonably priced for the amount of product you get and a little goes a very long way.
Output:positive
Input:I'd give it zero stars if I could. I've used several other microwavable wax brands before without issue. I have had overflow in the microwave if I out it in for too long but usually only a drip. The instructions said to put it in for three minutes, I put it in for two.

Input:I’ve been trying different brands of these strips for my eyes, these are easy to use. I guess they’re good for the money, some of them can be too expensive. I like that they come with a little spoon to separate them. They’re better if you keep them in the fridge.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I have used Norelco razors for over 40 years, and have always sworn by them. My father and both grandfathers used them--and now, my son. However, I am now looking at other brands for the first time ever. I have had three SpeedXL models in the past year--and all have had the on/off switch go bad within a few months. One of the razors was replaced by Norelco--but I am tired of the hassle of undependable razors! The last one woke us up in the middle of the night when it turned on by itself. The razors do give a very nice shave--they just do not last very long.
Output:negative
Input:Best hairspray I've ever used at any price point!  Hair is not like a ""helmet"" yet holds the style great.  Brushes out easily and does not cause your hair to be ""dirty"" with hairspray.  In addition, you're not spraying the entire bathroom with hairspray since one can easily direct the spray where you want it with no ""over spray"" like ""canned"" hair sprays.  You also don't need a ""gas mask"" when you use it.  Has a great subtle fragrance that won't compete with any other fragrance you might be wearing.  Would recommend to anyone other all other brands available.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product since it appears that no other store/sales enterprise wishes to sell it!
Output:positive
Input:These do not stay on your nails! Soon after I put them on they would come off by doing normal things.  Sad part is I would look down and notice one missing and wondered ""where is it"" like the lost sock in the laundry its unknown where the nail adhesives ended up.  I've used other brands and never had a problem, they stayed on until I took them off.
Output:negative
Input:I’ve used many brands of nail strips with much success. NOT THESE. The adhesion didn’t last more than 2 hours. Other brands lasted me weeks. These unfortunately are going in the trash. Do not buy.
Output:negative
Input:I've been wearing extensions for over 15 years- clip ins, tapes, Great Lengths, you name it. I've tried many different brands. I was very excited to try these- based on the reviews and the price. Let me tell you- save your $$.  I purchased on the Canadian site where you can see my verified review but wanted to leave this here also to save other people from my misfortune.<br /><br />When they arrived, the hair looked beautiful. It was healthy and shiny looking. I ordered 4 bundles- 16inch, 18inch and 2 packs of 20inch. The 20inches were tied too tight on the tape bonds when they arrived- it left a funny wavy dent that made it impossible to seal properly during installation. Fortunately, it wasn't all of them, but quite a few were un-usable. They were also very thin at the ends, like other reviews stated, and had to be trimmed an inch or two off the bottom to make it look decent.<br /><br />I had an important event coming up and had already booked my appointment to have them professionally installed, so I just cut my losses and ordered another pack of 16inch to make up the difference. So I bought 5 packs in total. All in colour 8/60.<br /><br />When I first had them installed, they looked great. Up until the first wash... I have now had them in for 2 weeks- I just washed them for the 3rd time last night. I know how to care for extensions- I sleep with a silk scarf over them after putting into a loose braid, use only the highest quality products, deep condition below the bond for minimum 30 min after each wash, use minimal heat, and use a good heat protector when I do. After only TWO WEEKS- the hair is garbage (see photo) I will have to take them out. The photo is AFTER I attempted to smooth them out and cut off another inch. They are full of split ends, and look disgusting. I'm wondering if these are even real hair at this point. They feel and look like cheap doll hair.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the other reviews were either written directly after install and not after washing or wearing for even a few days- or if I got a bad batch??  Maybe the darker colours are better. I don't know. All I know is I'm super disappointed and out of pocket over $500 after install.  The only good thing I can say is that the tape itself is strong and stayed in.
Output:negative
Input:Pros:<br /><br />1.  Good shave, after break in period.  Not the best I've had for my skin/beard type.  Several passes were needed for my beard which is course.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  Like other users' complaints about the hinge design, the flip up mechanism is highly fragile.  I wish I sent it back to Norelco, instead I threw into the trash can I was so angry!  Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk!<br /><br />2.  The Cool Skin additive is not worth it.  Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl's and get more for your money and better product.  It's delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads.<br /><br />3.  The trimmer is a hassle to put on if you're looking for a speedy morning shave. Other brands/models have a flip up design, which I thought every shaver had.<br /><br />Good luck.
Output:negative
Input:You can find other brands that work better. Not work the money
Output:negative
Input:Package came right on time.  I've been using a product that I buy from my local beauty supply store and I have been unhappy with it, as it always lifts.  I've tried other brands and was never happy with them.  My nails never came out like at the salon.  I decided to try this product out and I am so happy with it.  I absolutely love it!  I was very impressed and also surprised at how well this product works.  I will recommend this products to my friends =)
Output:positive
Input:I travel 50% of the time and love these for air travel and for the hotel.  They are soft and very dark.  I have tried many brands and find these the best.<br />Like all eye masks, you will get lines sometimes on your face if you sleep on your side.
Output:positive
Input:I bought two different brands of face paint pallets that were same price. This one came with some cracks in the paint cakes and some chunks floating around in the containers, not too big of deal I guess. But when using the paint, yikes, not good. They were not very opaque. Had a hard time getting them to apply in a decent fashion. This one definitely lost over the other pallet. The plus side is, it does come with some sticker stencils, and a pack of wipes and paint brushes. For it being so cheap, that does help make up a little bit for the quality. I would not but this one again though.
Output:negative
Input:I've had this soap for a little over a month now and I really wanted to love this brand, but honestly I don't. It is very &#34;dry&#34; and coarse. It crumbles very easily and actually scratches my skin if I'm not careful. It also has a lot of white marks all through the bar which seems to be from it being charred or burnt. There is also a strong &#34;burnt&#34; smell to the bar too. I get that there may be some ash from the way black soap is made, but the bar I received is just not the quality I've experienced with other brands.
Output:negative
Input:Let me first start by saying I never write reviews of products. I love this product. It is very soothing and seems to have a sortof plumping effect. I have VERY sensitive skin. Pretty much breaks out at the site of skincare products. I have tried everything from Cr&egrave;me De La Mer to drugstore brands and I love this brand!! I wish I had know about it during my 3 pregnancies when my skin was a disaster!  And every time I order and they send a sample I get hooked on a new product. Good thing is the products are reasonably priced for the amount of product you get and a little goes a very long way.
Output:positive
Input:I'd give it zero stars if I could. I've used several other microwavable wax brands before without issue. I have had overflow in the microwave if I out it in for too long but usually only a drip. The instructions said to put it in for three minutes, I put it in for two. The jar melted and the entire wax contents went all over my microwave. Now I have to purchase a new microwave dish because there is no getting this stuff off. This is a waste of money and a hazzard.

Ġlashes,Ġdifference,"Input:this is the worst thing i have ever bought. it may have just been my kit but first i was only delivered one set of lashes. then the magnets arent even working.
Output:negative
Input:These beautiful 5D lashes are perfect! They arrived super quick, the packaging is so cute, and best of all they’re Vegan lashes that look and feel like natural mink fibers! The band stays put on my eyes all day without peeling up at the inner corner. I absolutely love love love these lashes and will never go back to drugstore brands when these are such a great deal. I wear lashes every day, and I get so many compliments on these. Perfect for a dramatic look!
Output:positive
Input:It does what it says and it doesn't take long. Just one pinch of the curler and it's done. It also keeps my eyelashes curled. My Revlon curler needed me to squeeze squeeze and hold and squeeze and hold and my lashes would limp after a couple of hours anyway. This does the trick. I love it so much I ordered another one just I case I misplace it or my daughter swipes it.<br /><br />NOTE for those with bigger eyes:  My eyes are large and almond shape, I put a longer rubber piece in it and it won't pinch my skin now. Still one squeeze and that's all I need and they stay curled. LOVE IT.
Output:positive
Input:I apply a base liner first for a nice smooth line as this product is a little thick. I have hooded eyes so I can't do a very thick line. Once lashes are applied, they stay on nicely.
Output:positive
Input:My lashes look great with this product.  I will never use another mascara!
Output:positive
Input:Great lashes- bang for the buck! Easy to apply, lightweight, non irritating. Kit gives you lots of looks to choose from.
Output:positive
Input:These lashes are really good for the price they are going for ! They are also really lightweight considering how long they are 🥰I will be getting more!
Output:positive
Input:I love these! I get so many compliments and people can't believe I did my own false lashes
Output:positive
Input:I had tried this brand of lash before and really liked it so I decided to try some a bit “fuller” these were perfect. Sorry for the quick pic with headphones on 🤷🏻‍♀️ But I had to show how good these lashes look on! They are lightweight, comfortable and I don’t even feel I am wearing them. I wear false lashes regularly so I am a bit picky about the lashes I use but this brand has not disappointed me yet. And the price is unbeatable for the quality!
Output:positive
Input:These lashes are beautiful but are much too long for my eye line. The magnets are located at the end of the lashes, so you cannot trim them smaller. The lashes would be great for a person with larger eye.
Output:negative
Input:Beautiful lashes looks just like the photo shipping was fantastic I ordered it Saturday night received it Sunday afternoon
Output:positive
Input:The only good thing about this product is the packaging. The lash tweezers were super cheap and poor quality. The eyeliner was THE WORST. It doesn’t go on smooth and forget about readjusting if you don’t get them on perfect the first time. If the lashes move all the eyeliner comes off with it. And the lashes are heavy from the magnets.
Output:negative
Input:This curler was so inexpensive yet so beautiful (LOVE the rose gold) and works perfectly. This is just as good as any other eyelash curler on the market, it’s well made and keeps your lashes up all day. I will never spend more than $7 on an eyelash curler again!
Output:positive
Input:Bought these for my wife.  After watching videos and reading reviews she had hoped the lashes with magnets on each end would be a better fit than the ones with a single magnet in the center.  The problem with these is the lash is straight and gaps at the center, so you find yourself trying to see past the bottom lash that’s in your line of vision.
Output:negative

Input:I purchased this because I like the look, but don't have the time or patience to do this myself.  The black matches my hair color wonderfully and looks very natural. I like the way it looks whether my hair is up or down.<br /><br />I received this at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review, this does not change my opinion of the product in any way.
Output:positive
Input:Everything arrived on time undamaged and in perfect conditions I love this product. I am very satisfied with it. I even had to order an extra one for a friend after she seen my results.
Output:positive
Input:This doesn’t work what so ever! Wasted of money and time!
Output:negative
Input:This is more a thick oil or serum, not as easy to apply as a lotion but thick enough that it doesn’t run all over so can be applied.  The smell is pretty neutral and subtle.  It does not sting or leave any unpleasant feeling like some magnesium products.  It is not a magic lotion that will put your child to sleep instantaneously.  It will relax your child though allowing them to fall asleep with time.  More importantly it will help their quality of sleep through the night.  The bottle isn’t huge but you only need a squirt per foot so it lasts a while.  The small size makes it easy to travel with as well.
Output:positive
Input:This little light works great, The timers are perfect. I can fit all five fingers in but prefer to do the 4, then the thumb for more comfort. Shipping was on time. Plugged it in and it was ready to go, no need to assemble anything or peel anything. Great LED light. Just don't be tempted to touch your nails in between steps.  It does its job if you finish all steps. I used Gellish products for gel nails.

Input:Use all the time! Always get compliments
Output:positive
Input:I fell in love with my chair after the first use.  My muscles were so sore that I had to wait several days to use it a 2nd time.  I had an even better session the 2nd time around.  But the 3rd session killed it.  My favorite setting is the whole body massage setting in manual mode.  It cycles up and down all the way from your neck down to your hips.  On my 3rd use, this setting stopped working properly.  It would either go up to your neck or down to your lower back, and then it would stop there.  That's it.  No ""whole"" body as the remote control states.  It still works overall, but without that setting I have to constantly manipulate the controls.  That's not relaxing.  The purpose of a massage is total relaxation.  You can't get that if you're playing with the remote control every 20 seconds.
Output:negative
Input:The worst product I bought over the past year.<br />Smells like my granny’s perfum, oxidizes on skin drastically, makes my skin shine like an oily crepe and look cakey at the same time. Settles in pores over time.
Output:negative
Input:Good bye, bye razor bumps on your skin! This product is perfect. I mainly use it for my armpit. Specifically during summer time I wear strapless shirts, I love the smooth skin without the visible dark dots that you get when you shave and, NO WAX MESS! Totally worth it!<br /><br />Tip: I use a blowdryer to heat up the strip only because it's faster, it takes like 10 seconds with the blowdryer. You will get the same results if you heat up the strip with your hands it just takes a few minutes to be ready. Also, make sure you let your hair grow at a fair length 😉.
Output:positive
Input:Just used for the first time today and I was amazed and surprised at the quality of this dryer it was quieter than most blow dries rather fast!!! Better than ones I have paid a lot of money for and heat factor was perfect!!! It was so far a 5 star purchase and I pray it stays that way!!!
Output:positive
Input:The bottle was not sealed closed. 1/3 rd of the bottle was gone by the time I unboxed it. So dissapointed!
Output:negative
Input:To me this was a total waste of money. I put them on, watched a movie and by the time I went to bed they were loose and I ended up peeling them off. I really don't think they would stay on for any length of time, certainly not for an important event. Just wasn't for me
Output:negative
Input:This product has always been a favorite for speeding up the disappearance of bruising anywhere on the body and including the face area (although it is recommended for face bruising to rather take the tablets). This homeopathic product is recommended by doctors for numerous reasons such as easing arthritis and relieving soreness. Take care to keep the ointment away from the eyes. I notice my bruises vanishing in half the time. Wonderful product. I highly recommend this.
Output:positive
Input:This is so light, yet stays in place with long, thick hair!  It is twice the size of what I’ve used and it’s very comfortable, especially since I wear it for 12+ hours at a time.

Ġthin,Ġdoes,"Input:I really like this  hair dryer. It worked well for traveling. Did not take up much room I thought it would blow a little more. Took longer for my hair to dry and I have thin hair. But I enjoy taking in to travel because of the bag and folding to make it smaller.
Output:positive
Input:I have tried several of these over the past few months and while this is easily the best one, I personally don't think it is worth the 3 bills they are asking.<br /><br />the retail packaging on this is fantastic and the hard shell box it comes in is a big bonus, but as far as the device itself it seems to be on par with some half this price. I personally would rather received it in a plain box to save a little money. The one little thing that Is super convenient that stands out is this has the proper size cable ties already on it and they're not Velcro! They are button snaps and that is a great thing because the Velcro ties get full of hair and fuzz.<br /><br />And Like similar devices with the the cold touch thing it is a little weird the first time you feel it. because you think it feels warm but it's not, it just messes with your head a bit. And so far with this feature you can't really feel this one doing anything until you get a little overlap in the same session. So that is nice.<br /><br />And with this one I have noticed some results.<br />I have been testing these on different small sections of my leg in the same area trying to get a consistent controlled test and I'm keeping track of how long it takes. I'm a big Burley guy so there's no shortage of hair on my legs. lol<br />So with this one after about 4 weeks using it twice a week I do see the hair thinning out a bit. But a couple devices half this price did the same thing. And it is definitely heating the hair. To make sure I tried it on an unshaved area and it definitely stings a little as the fully exposed hairs heat up. But, a couple others did this as well.<br /><br />So is it worth it for you? Maybe. if you want a premium feel and look with everything like you bought it at Neiman Marcus, buy this one.<br />But if you just want hair removal and don't care about the packaging there are cheaper options available.
Output:positive
Input:Made of very thin plastic not the best purchase
Output:negative
Input:Thinnest hair you will ever buy on Amazon so far. I keep trying different brands and they keep getting worse and worse. The wave completely disappears after one wash and I’ll have to cut at least 4 inches off just to even out all the thin, frizzy,  scraggly ends. I have thin hair already but if you have thick hair it definitely wouldn’t blend in. Not sure who the folks are writing rave reviews. They must get paid for them.
Output:negative
Input:These are a qreat. They hold well and don't break easily. They are also not too thick but not too thin. Great Value.
Output:positive
Input:The ends are way too thin. I purchased a single bundle to add to my other bundles which I purchased from a different company big mistake.
Output:negative
Input:I think this worked as an awesome day or night cream, it was not too thick or too thin, but right in the middle. Not oily at all either. Worked great for my sensitive skin as well. Didn't make me break out so that's also a plus. I'm young so I don't yet have wrinkles but better safe then sorry
Output:positive
Input:Ends of this Hair is extremely thin.... I ordered 6 bundles 20 22 24 I’m sending it back
Output:negative
Input:Very thin ends, also shorter than 16 inches,<br /> not all quality hair, very broken and small scrap of hair.
Output:negative
Input:This nail polish doesn't last for more than a few hours. I feel that its more fit for a little girl who likes to change their polish color every few hours or every day. The polish is very small and thin and just overall poor quality. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
Output:negative
Input:I have been using yellow SALUX Nylon Japanese washcloths for about 20 years.  In the past few years I have been unable to find them at my health food store or a local Japanese market.  I was really excited to find them at Amazon and I ordered two.  Unfortunately, the towels that arrived are not even the SALUX brand.  They are something called Leyijie - which is thin and decidedly inferior to the Salux.  Amazon and the vendor should both be embarassed to send this product when Salux is pictured and advertised.
Output:negative
Input:It does a decent job covering my dark lines, but it settles in the lines and really accentuates them. I moisturize before, of course, and have tried dabbing moisturizer over the top too, but it still happens.  My skin is fairly oily and thin. I was really hoping it would work well.
Output:negative
Input:Let me start off by saying the woman that reviewed saying how she was so happy about the piece of plastic that 'sealed' the bottle instead of being wrapped in a bunch of plastic must really not know about wasteful plastic it would be alot easier to recycle a little thin plastic than this huge chunk that does NOT even seal the product I would know because mine was setting in the bottom of the box and oil was coming out of my container so not only was this not sealed but someone had previously pumped the bottle to get product out because it was completely full in the stem and coming out of the nozzle I'm furious because this isn't sanitary at all and anyone could have refilled these with a dollar store baby oil or something because it doesnt small fruity like the description says on the bottle it smells musky and chemically im disgusted. I have lupus so I'm always very careful about things anyways trhing to not get sick especially with everything going on in the world and I'm not about to put an unsealed product on my face to see if it causes a reaction anyone can mess with products like this and it's scary because there are people out there that would put dangerous stuff into products just because they felt like it now I'm gonna have to figire out how to return this right now or this is all getting dumped somewhere and recycled because this is disappointing and disgusting
Output:negative
Input:This thing is terrible. Doesn't deserve one star.  It's winter so it arrived wet and cold, yuck.  When it dries, it is so hard and stiff the instructions tell you not to unfold it when it is dry.  I can't even imagine wetting this thing so I can dry my hair.<br /><br />Update: I decided to try it wet. I wet it, wrung it out, and used it. Awful! I have long hair, but it is thin. It dripped water down my back and my hair was still really wet 30 minutes later  Now it is in the trash and that should have happened before, just felt like I should give it a chance.

Input:These products always confuse me do they come with a safety seal or not when I opened this bottle it seemed like it had been open and some of the oil was missing from the top not a big deal The product itself is pretty good I was under the impression it was going to blow my mind but after a few uses I can't really notice too much of a difference but I do like that it's from a faraway land
Output:positive
Input:The product itself is decent.<br />It reminds me of oil of olay. But it's about half the price has no scent. Feels nice, light weight and hydrating. More of a daily use face cream<br /><br />However, this was a two pack and I was only sent one.

Input:Bought this for my boyfriend and overrall it was good! Packaging was nice and neat and useful and the things inside were nice! The only problem we had with it was that the components are really small! The only items sized appropriately are the comb and styling scissors. Though... If you purchase this kit as a starter kit for beard care it’s pretty reasonable. You get to sample the oil and creams to see what you prefer and it works really nicely for that purpose! This being said, it took him nearly two weeks of everyday use of one of the creams to empty the scented tin. The tins are about the size of a 50 cent piece. It isnt a forever piece but definitely good for a beard care beginner!

Input:I ordered Majestic Pure Mango Butter as I had ordered the Majestic Pure Coconut oil and fell in love with it. From early on from when I was a teenager my mom mixed different products together to come up with what working for her and her skin.  I like missing things up and adding to.  I like that the Pure Mango butter is 100% natural with no other ingredients added so that the only thing that is added is what I personally mix it with.  I opened this a few days ago and I was not surprised by the texture of the butter.  It melts quickly when I placed a small amount in my hand and rubbed both hands together.  I look forward to adding with some of my essential oils.  With the winter months coming I want to be able to make some of my own lotions depending on what I need them for.  A little bit of peppermint here and a little bit of wintergreen there.  I received my order of the Majestic Pure Mango butter at a promotional price for my own honest and unbiased opinion.

Input:I was leery about using a product with oil to clean my face.  I’m in my 50s and needed something to help remove waterproof mascara and makeup so I did my research and decided to give this a try.  I pump two squirts in my hand and then rub it on my face and eyes and then add a small amount of water on my hands and rub on my face to emulsify.  I then use a warm, wet washcloth to remove the makeup.  Sometimes I have to use a little more on my eyes for the waterproof mascara but it works!  My face is not greasy after I rinse and then continue with my nighttime routine.  I will continue to purchase this product.

Input:Here is my review of the @Miaadora Super Oil Blend-<br />.<br />.<br />I took my sweet time with this review cause I actually wanted to really use this products and see some results! Naturally, I have extremely straight, almost non-existent lashes with out curling the crap out of them and using a lot of mascara. I still end up wearing falsies because my natural lashes are just not where I’d like them. I’ve been using Super oil blend on my lashes about about 2 weeks now and I’ve actually noticed a difference! My lashes are noticeably fuller, and even look a little longer to me. It has been a lot easier for me to apply falsies because my lashes are actually there and gives the falsies something to grab on too and it just feels nice 👍  I started using super oil blend on my brows a little bit too to help them grow hair is a few patchy spots I have, but I had to stop because it was causing me to break out around my brow area. so idk if I recommend it for the face if you have super sensitive or acne prone skin, like myself. Overall this product didn’t disappoint at all, just like the many other amazing products @miaadora puts out! So if you’re struggling with growing your lashes I DEFINITELY recommend this product ❤️

Ġgets,Ġwhole,"Input:This is my second time using opalescence. I got the first kit from my dentist and was really impressed with the results. After using all the whitening toothpastes and other over the counter treatments, I found with this, I finally had white teeth! During the treatment, I did get some teeth burn; it’s powerful stuff! But using a sensitive toothpaste helped leave he ate that. Plus I didn’t mind so much that it hurt because I knew it was working. The whitening agent really gets deep into the enamel. I’m so glad I found these on Amazon because it was a lot less than buying them from my dentist.

Input:The quality of few hair bands which are thin ones is not that good while putting to hair it just looses its elastic and gets cut . But some are good which is thick .
Output:negative
Input:It is clumpy and gets all over
Output:negative
Input:I am returning because the product I received tore<br /> my hair. Every time you take it off hair gets turn which is annoying. Also metal quality low.
Output:negative
Input:The little tripod is small and simple.  Charger works fine, gets a little hotter than I'd expected, but that may be because of the higher capacity batteries.
Output:positive
Input:So upset that this product is discontinued by sephora as it's the only cleanser my boyfriend will use :-( will have to find an alternative once he's out of the two bottles i bought him. This warming cleanser is sticky, but gets all the dirt and oil out without drying the skin.
Output:positive
Input:Hey - I admit it - I'm a &#34;bling&#34; girl.  Royal blue is one of my favorite colors... so this hair accent always gets me compliments.
Output:positive
Input:Great clipper guards very strong magnets. Bush soft and gets the job done
Output:positive
Input:This doesn't need to be applied every day but, there was no option for never. There is not a daily rather, a monthly or every other month application needed. It's very easy to use but, the other reviewers are right about dying the eyebrows in &#34;rounds&#34; because if you leave it on too long, you'll dye the skin for a day or so and that looks sloppy. I suggest being very deliberate with the application by focusing on painting on the strands and using a Q-tip to clean up the dye that gets onto the skin immediately. I usually apply the color 2-4 times in a session. I apply and let sit for 1.5 minutes then wipe off the dye with soap and washcloth and repeat until I feel like the color looks right.
Output:positive
Input:The hair gets extremely tangled very easily. Hard to get untangled. It’s a mess, I threw it away!
Output:negative
Input:Did not like the scent of the product. I noticed in the warning section it said avoid contact with eyes. How is that possible when it’s made for babies. The product is made with all natural ingredients so why is it dangerous if it gets in eyes. Would not recommend this product. Label looks nice btw that’s about it.
Output:negative
Input:Horribly thick and greasy....feel like machine grease! I like several other Badger products...especially the Damascus Rose facial sunscreen....which has a nice consistency and also contains a slight tint to help cover the zinc oxide. But this product ended up in the trash after I tried and tried to use it...mainly on the backs of my hands and my forearms.....but I got tired of it laying on my skin and never getting absorbed. It actually feels weird on my skin. I recycle all plastic, so getting all of the goop .....I cannot even call it a lotion or a cream.....out of the tube and into the trash was a very messy and disgusting experience. Sorry...this product gets a big thumbs down from me.
Output:negative
Input:It takes a little elbow grease, but it works really well, gets out old lint, hair, etc. I have trouble finding hair brushes that work on my fine hair, so I like that it prolongs hairbrush life
Output:positive
Input:Upon reading the reviews, it seemed that the one I wanted (the one pictured)was the one people were getting so I went ahead and ordered.  Well, I got a blue one with a faux Angry Birds theme.  Not at all what I wanted and not even a pattern I had seen.  Hoping to return it, but waiting to see if the return gets approved.  The item is generally the same, but I was looking for something to make haircut time easier for our little ones and sometimes cowboys and astronauts might just help, whereas unpleasant looking birds probably not so much.<br />Depending on the purpose of the order, buyer beware.  If you just want a cape and design isn't part of why you are choosing this, go for it.  If you think you are going to get a specific design, based on my experience and the other reviewers...Do Not Order!!!<br /><br />May 6, 2013...<br />I want to update: this cape has already gone to the trash.  After only a couple of uses, it was torn beyond use.  It took very little fidgeting to tear the collar away from the cape and once that started, it wasn't long before there was such a hole the thing was useless.  I can't stress enough...WASTE OF MONEY!<br />Yes, I tried to return, but since so much of the cost was in shipping and I was being required to pay return shipping (even though not what I ordered!) I would have been paying them to replace it!
Output:negative
Input:Hair gets really tangled and it's very shiny. But it's cute for pictures and wearing a hat. Also the extra headband doesn't cover the other headband, it's too small.

Input:So upset that this product is discontinued by sephora as it's the only cleanser my boyfriend will use :-( will have to find an alternative once he's out of the two bottles i bought him. This warming cleanser is sticky, but gets all the dirt and oil out without drying the skin.
Output:positive
Input:Hey - I admit it - I'm a &#34;bling&#34; girl.  Royal blue is one of my favorite colors... so this hair accent always gets me compliments.
Output:positive
Input:Great clipper guards very strong magnets. Bush soft and gets the job done
Output:positive
Input:This doesn't need to be applied every day but, there was no option for never. There is not a daily rather, a monthly or every other month application needed. It's very easy to use but, the other reviewers are right about dying the eyebrows in &#34;rounds&#34; because if you leave it on too long, you'll dye the skin for a day or so and that looks sloppy. I suggest being very deliberate with the application by focusing on painting on the strands and using a Q-tip to clean up the dye that gets onto the skin immediately. I usually apply the color 2-4 times in a session. I apply and let sit for 1.5 minutes then wipe off the dye with soap and washcloth and repeat until I feel like the color looks right.
Output:positive
Input:The hair gets extremely tangled very easily. Hard to get untangled. It’s a mess, I threw it away!
Output:negative
Input:Did not like the scent of the product. I noticed in the warning section it said avoid contact with eyes. How is that possible when it’s made for babies. The product is made with all natural ingredients so why is it dangerous if it gets in eyes. Would not recommend this product. Label looks nice btw that’s about it.
Output:negative
Input:Horribly thick and greasy....feel like machine grease! I like several other Badger products...especially the Damascus Rose facial sunscreen....which has a nice consistency and also contains a slight tint to help cover the zinc oxide. But this product ended up in the trash after I tried and tried to use it...mainly on the backs of my hands and my forearms.....but I got tired of it laying on my skin and never getting absorbed. It actually feels weird on my skin. I recycle all plastic, so getting all of the goop.....I cannot even call it a lotion or a cream.....out of the tube and into the trash was a very messy and disgusting experience. Sorry...this product gets a big thumbs down from me.
Output:negative
Input:It takes a little elbow grease, but it works really well, gets out old lint, hair, etc. I have trouble finding hair brushes that work on my fine hair, so I like that it prolongs hairbrush life
Output:positive
Input:Upon reading the reviews, it seemed that the one I wanted (the one pictured)was the one people were getting so I went ahead and ordered.  Well, I got a blue one with a faux Angry Birds theme.  Not at all what I wanted and not even a pattern I had seen.  Hoping to return it, but waiting to see if the return gets approved.  The item is generally the same, but I was looking for something to make haircut time easier for our little ones and sometimes cowboys and astronauts might just help, whereas unpleasant looking birds probably not so much.<br />Depending on the purpose of the order, buyer beware.  If you just want a cape and design isn't part of why you are choosing this, go for it.  If you think you are going to get a specific design, based on my experience and the other reviewers...Do Not Order!!!<br /><br />May 6, 2013...<br />I want to update: this cape has already gone to the trash.  After only a couple of uses, it was torn beyond use.  It took very little fidgeting to tear the collar away from the cape and once that started, it wasn't long before there was such a hole the thing was useless.  I can't stress enough...WASTE OF MONEY!<br />Yes, I tried to return, but since so much of the cost was in shipping and I was being required to pay return shipping (even though not what I ordered!) I would have been paying them to replace it!
Output:negative
Input:Hair gets really tangled and it's very shiny. But it's cute for pictures and wearing a hat. Also the extra headband doesn't cover the other headband, it's too small.

Input:It needs a like 2 more tracks to look full and shreds a bit but not too bad I still love it ill add the tracks in myself no problem, and keep getting compliments. Very versatile
Output:positive
Input:The wig is surprisingly nice for such a low price, I really wasn't expecting much.  The fibers are soft and look and feel like real hair.  Unfortunately the cap was far too large for me and I will be returning it.
Output:positive
Input:It’s definitely as big as what it looks like in the picture the red is really really red just like the image. The hair keeps falling out right out the package I didn’t touch it or anything but there’s curls all over my floor not bad but the hair definitely sheds. Very bouncy and fluffy.
Output:positive
Input:Going on a cruise and these bottles will definitely be perfect for the shower since they have suction cups. Really like these. A+
Output:positive
Input:I got it at a home show and I like it. I let my daughter try it and she likes it too. We both have dry skin. So I found it at amazon and bought it.<br />Great product but a lit pricy!
Output:positive
Input:Did not like the stiffness at all. It makes it hard to lock together
Output:negative
Input:I’ve used this product before and it was fine. I ordered my own and just received. I put it on and my face started burning like crazy. This didn’t happen last time. My teen daughter tried to see if it was just me. Her face started burning as well. This product is not made same as batch I used from  my moms order. And it will not allow returns.

Input:I like the product, is stings but feels nice. However, it doesn’t plump anything
Output:negative
Input:I love the fact of how easy it was to use & how wonderful it smelled. Also I’ll come back & do an update as to what my feet look like in a week. They started almost peeling immediately. Follow the instructions plzz. I would most definitely recommend.
Output:positive
Input:I really like this product. The ease of application, and the brown color is perfect with my hair. It does not look like fake brows. It dried quickly on the brow. I would recommend this for a nicely shaped brow. No mess and simple.
Output:positive
Input:My 4 yr old loves them! I probably should have ordered more than 1 set for Xmas. She might like them a little too much- I’ve caught her putting them on her baby brother a few times “so he can be cuter”.
Output:positive
Input:14inch Body Wave Human Hair Lace Front 360 - This wig looks NOTHING like the pictures, and I'm talking about quality, not length. It doesn't look natural black, but more like natural brown hair that comes from an older or stressed woman because of the massive amount of grays in it. It is very thin and you cannot pull all the hair up into a pony because the wefts are not sewn correctly - for easy manipulation into a pony. The hair is extremely broken at the edges and it doesn't look healthy. Also, the seller places a card in the box that encourages you to write a good review in exchange for a free wig so I would be skeptical of all the 5 and 4 star reviews.
Output:negative
Input:I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.
Output:positive
Input:I am not amazed by this product. Normally I enjoy products by this brand, but this scrub does not make the cut for me personally. The biggest problems I have with with this scrub are the unnatural dyes, they could've been left out there is no need for them. In my opinion the dye almost cheapens the perceived value of the product as the color is very bright and unnatural. It exfoliates very lightly. All in all I would not consider buying this product for myself again.<br />Disclaimer: The coupon code for this product was provided to me for evaluation purposes. My thinking here reflects all my own personal purchasing decision processes and reactions, and hopefully may help clarify if this product best fits your own needs and expectations.<br />If you find that my review would help others to make decisions on purchasing this product, please click on the &#34;YES&#34; vote button. I am always looking forward to improving my reviews, so that others just like you, can benefit from my personal experience with this product! Thank you all very much, I hope some of you find this review helpful in your buying decisions!

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I really wanted this item for the price point and the good reviews, but upon opening it did not work. Disappointed because I really like the size. This seller did not offer exchanges, only amazon credit or refunds.
Output:negative
Input:It needs a like 2 more tracks to look full and shreds a bit but not too bad I still love it ill add the tracks in myself no problem, and keep getting compliments. Very versatile
Output:positive
Input:The wig is surprisingly nice for such a low price, I really wasn't expecting much.  The fibers are soft and look and feel like real hair.  Unfortunately the cap was far too large for me and I will be returning it.
Output:positive
Input:It’s definitely as big as what it looks like in the picture the red is really really red just like the image. The hair keeps falling out right out the package I didn’t touch it or anything but there’s curls all over my floor not bad but the hair definitely sheds. Very bouncy and fluffy.
Output:positive
Input:Going on a cruise and these bottles will definitely be perfect for the shower since they have suction cups. Really like these. A+
Output:positive
Input:I got it at a home show and I like it. I let my daughter try it and she likes it too. We both have dry skin. So I found it at amazon and bought it.<br />Great product but a lit pricy!
Output:positive
Input:Did not like the stiffness at all. It makes it hard to lock together
Output:negative
Input:I’ve used this product before and it was fine. I ordered my own and just received. I put it on and my face started burning like crazy. This didn’t happen last time. My teen daughter tried to see if it was just me. Her face started burning as well. This product is not made same as batch I used from  my moms order. And it will not allow returns.

Ġwish,Ġvery,"Input:some how I keep finding the wrong cover for my kindle- That is my fault, I am sure. This one does not fit properly. I wish it was more clear on on my kindle on what kindle it is and that the covers fit that description
Output:negative
Input:Wow!  I wish I had known the problems I would have with this lemon I would've made sure I took Norelco up on their satisfaction guarantee!  I have an old 5601X that works as well.  I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!
Output:negative
Input:Works extremely well. It pulled out a lot of blackheads from my nose/forehead and then closed the pores with the third mask. I was pretty skeptical until I saw the difference between the treated and untreated area. The pores that were treated are obviously smaller. I wish it came with a few more packs for the price though. It’s only good for 3 treatments.
Output:positive
Input:Man, I wish Axe never got rid of this scent. It's really awesome. It's perfect for those Friday and Saturday nights that you're going out. A perfect blend of warm woods and leather, awesome fragrance.
Output:positive
Input:I purchased this and after about 3 months the anti-fog properties wore off.  I struggled to use it for about 9 more months until I finally got fed up with this and stopped using it.<br /><br />I attempted to take this off my shower wall today and it's been a complete disaster.  This DOES NOT easily remove from your walls.  It's all broken into small pieces on my wall and there is small bits of silicone stuck that I can't remove.  I wish I never bought this product, I absolutely hate it.
Output:negative
Input:I really like this toothbrush. Is the perfect balance, is not to soft or to hard. I was a little concerned about not having the rubber for grip but the design of the toothbrush is amazing and way better that the rubber. Is light for easy brushing and the shape falls perfect into the hand so it’s really comfortable. I’m really happy about this purchase. I only wish every toothbrush was black (I really liked that one)
Output:positive
Input:The only thing I wish they came with your numbers beside the lashes it was kind of hard to find the match to each one
Output:positive
Input:Very good flex rollers. These work pretty much as they are described. I do wish they actually bent a little better, but for the most part, I feel they work 90% perfectly. Awesome carrying case and huge selection of sizes. I feel this is a great investment. Highly recommend.
Output:positive
Input:decent machine to have for shaving your head and face as a travel shaver does a pretty good job, just wish the motor was a little bit stronger. depending on how long I let my hair grow it could require me to save my hair down be for I get the effect I want with the shaver.<br />Update shaver died and stopped working within the first six month...... not sure if it was this particular unit was bad or if this do to poor quality.
Output:negative
Input:I love these products! They smell amazing and make my hair super soft. I wish the conditioner came with a pump like the leave in because it’s super thick and hard to squeeze out. Other then that I really like them
Output:positive
Input:Really glad I bought this! I hesitated on buying the taller version and now I wish I did! I’ve got a demanding curly bob and a green thumb so I’m filling up pretty often between misting my plants and refreshing my curls. Love the continuous spray, thankful that I haven’t encountered some of the issues other reviewers have had. Definitely have recommended this product to a few friends (fellow plant lovers and/or curly ladies). Pick one up, you won’t regret it!
Output:positive
Input:When I used them for the first time some of them broke. This was a waste of my money. I wish there was a half of one star. I don't not recommend no one to used these brushes. I wish I could put a picture of the broken ones but it wouldn't let me.

Input:[[VIDEOID:4ed06eaa8af668958e05688432c5266a]] I have used these clips every day since purchasing them. My hair is quite long and full, I prefer clips when my the back of my neck gets sweaty elbow length straight Caucasian hair.  Wake up *boom* my hair goes up. One clip is stored in the shower for when I'm conditioning my hair. Since i depend on them daily I do expect them to get lost or break over time. That in mind I opted for this set of 6 which o felt is a great value. The clips arrive in a durable plastic storage case, that was a nice surprise as well.<br />My first one broke about a month ago though normal wear and tear. I was opening the clip to place on my hair when it snapped. Luckily it still ""works"" even in its broken state as I can still get away with using it all day every day. And I'm happy to report it rarely gets tangled or pulls out hair (if ever).<br /><br />Overall I am satisfied with these clips, wish it hadn't snapped quite so early.<br /><br />(Haven't tried the hair rings, they are soft and the kind that leave your ponytail dent-free.)
Output:positive
Input:The only thing I don’t like is that i wish the bottles had the color on them to know which is which because they all look the same. Apart from that gel is the new nail polish I’m that girl that change my nails frequents soo I’m excited to play with these. So far I tested it out they apply wonderful & look beautiful. !!

Input:The hair didn’t last 24 hours.  It clumped together and looked horrible the next morning. I’m giving it 2 stars because perhaps an adult would be a little less hard on it and it may make it a whole week. But these are NOT durable. In fact, even putting them in would fray them so bad I ended up throwing away a third of them.

Input:The size and price of these little guys is great for traveling and carrying in your purse. The luxury face oil is great though didn't notice any dramatic changes or improvements. Found it good for hands and cuticles though. The Night Serum though...yikes. The morning after one use my skin was bright and happy. I tried it the next night and woke up to inflamed and angry cheeks and a chin full of red bumps. I saw my dermatologist who could not prove (or deny) that the serum was to blame but glycolic acid is definitely not something to take lightly. My skin took a long time to recover from bumps and dry skin. :(

Input:I have been using Gelish gel polish at home for 2-3 years now, using a UV light with perfect results for the standard 1-2 minute dry times. I then bought this product to speed up drying time, but it didn't work at all. After 30 seconds, my coat was still completely wet. Even after a full 2 minutes, the polish rubbed off with the next coat. I have since returned this lamp and would not recommend that others buy it for gel nail curing.
Output:negative
Input:I don’t usually write reviews, but let me just say..these things work and they stay on well. I bought these to bring with me on a trip with some girlfriends. We had a glam day and they brought our looks to the next level. The lashes were wonderful, lasted all day, and we probably could’ve gotten a lot more uses of them, but we were just using them as single wear. The blue ones were beautiful on my friend who had blue & green hair. I will be ordering another set of these once I go through the remaining pairs.<br /><br />I will say, the only downside was the eyeliner, it got gloopy very easily and was hard to come off even doing the double cleanse method. You need an oil based cleanser, a balm doesn’t really work either without scrubbing hard.  Ive found the two part oil & remover solutions work the best, the ones you shake. I did buy a felt tip magnetic eyeliner to try instead and that one seems to work ok, but the magnets pull off the liner. I think if they improved the eyeliner, these would be a 5/5 hands down.

Input:I absolutely love this kit. I have quite a collection of makeup brushes, however I didn't have a eyebrow brush. Most of the time I would just use whatever brush I could find to do my brows. Since using this kit, my brows look a million times better!<br /><br />The angled brush is the perfect width for brows. I use this with a brow powder, and it makes placing the product so easy, and you can manipulate the brush to create the illusion of eye brow hair. The brush is just overall fantastic. On the opposite end there is a spoolie. I like to use this in between swipes with the brush. I can brush out my brows, apply some product, and brush them out again. This gives my brows a very natural look, without taking away the product I just applied. It also softens them so they don't look harsh. Love it.<br /><br />The next piece in the kit is the eye lash comb and brow brush. I use the eye lash brush after applying mascara and letting it dry. This will remove any clumps that your mascara may have left, and fans out your lashes to look fuller and just amazing! The brow brush I use more often when I am using an eyebrow wax. Once I apply the wax, I can use this brush to create a more natural look. Again, it's fantastic!<br /><br />I really like this kit. It is a staple in my collection, and gets used daily. I love the packaging this comes in, if you need to travel, this is perfect! Place your brushes in the cylinder and they will be perfectly protected! 5 stars all around for this kit!<br /><br />*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

Input:Subtle yet noticeable & natural looking. I went a little light on my first run. It looked great but I wanted a little more color, so I applied again the next night with just a touch more product. It was perfect. And I didn’t even shower first. Super easy to apply. I’m not a product user, but this will be super easy to do routinely. I’ve heard to apply every couple days to maintain (as opposed to waiting a week), but haven’t gotten that far yet. I could easily do this multiple nights a week.

Input:Very vibrant burgundy red. Seems perfect for the young and bold or just the bold! I think next time we'll just do the natural black. I installed these in my teen daughter's head and she has a big head! Out of the 6 packs, I only used 4 with a little left over, and the hair is fully covered- no huge gaps- truly full head crochet. Very light weight, but I'm not sure how long these faux dreads will last. I'm guessing one week because they seem too delicate. Also, I bought the 16"" dreads and they measured exactly that.

Ġaway,Ġpretty,"Input:Honestly, I've already thrown it away. Both liners were dried out, the magnets were thin and weak and didn't actually stick well. The corners wouldn't stay down (other brands worked fine, this specific set was the problem). I was going to return it when I first opened it and saw that the liners were dry, but there was no option to print my own label, so I tried to make them work and ended up throwing the whole set away.
Output:negative
Input:I have been using CleanSmart products for a long time. I pushed away the nagging feeling this might just be water and not actually work after reading all the product's claims. It feels, smells, and acts like water. I noticed all products that have been shipped since Covid-19 have STOPPED labeling as killing 99.9% of bacterias. This is clearly suspicious and undermined my ability to trust in the product.
Output:negative
Input:I have been waiting over 30 minutes and the damn thing still has not come on. this is  junk and my stupidity bought 2 of them. and whats even worse I threw away the box and receipt because I have trusted amazon all this time. you  and chase bank know what you can do with the end of this diffuser.
Output:negative
Input:Arrived expeditiously at a decent price.  The scent has never been great.  (Been using for 60 years)  But the clean cooling effect is still great.  Nothing better on a HOT day.  Keep away from eyes, nose, mouth and those private parts
Output:positive
Input:These are the perfect touch for thank you card envelopes. I didn't realize I had ordered 500! But I have seriously challenged myself to give them all away! The first couple were unusable due to packaging and opening, but I really considered that a non-issue.

Input:This wig was just that a WIG. You can tell it's a wig when I tried it on. I even saw the tracks along the top. It was very hard to comb, it tangled and felt almost like a cheap barbie doll's hair.  Also it didn't appear to be the same as the picture on the website, mine had a little too much highlight in it, and that is not what I was going for. So I will return it. I tried to give it away to a few friends, they turned it down for the same reasons.

Input:Well ..... maybe I'm just all thumbs or my hair type/length is just wrong, but it was difficult for me to keep my hair wrapped around it to achieve a decent curl.  My hair is cut in about 5-6"" long layers.  Had to keep picking up the section of hair and trying again.  Kind of frustrating.  But it seemed to work in a few spots when I did it correctly, however, the end result doesn't motivate me to keep trying.  Again, it's probably just me.<br />I may give it away to someone with long hair, who might find it easier to use.

Output:negative
Input:Words can hardly express how disappointed I am with these oven guards.  I had the fabric ones, but they got kind of cruddy over time.  We thought these would be a great replacement.  They went on the rack edges with no trouble and they did take some of the heat away.  BUT after only three uses, the lower one started crumbling apart (and I swear I saw &#34;smoke&#34; at some point).  This was in a regular gas oven at about 375 degrees.  I am returning them and will try another brand.  Such a bummer.

Input:I don't normally feel the need to write a negative review- and trust me, this product is great- I mean $100.00 is ruinously expensive for this shampoo and conditioner. But I finally treated myself.<br />The conditioner arrived in the same box with the shampoo- in a bag only, with the pump already unscrewed and a whole lot of the product already leaked out into the aforementioned bag.<br />The shampoo was in it's own little box inside of the larger box that it was shipped in, not inside of a plastic bag. It did not have it's pump unscrewed, rather the entire life was slightly unscrewed and the shampoo had leaked out all over the bottle, the box and and packaging's entire insides.<br />What poor quality control and customer service- again, $100 worth of product in two bottles!!<br />Absolutely terrible presentation, shipping And quality control.<br />UNACCEPTABLE.<br />Learn to go above and beyond all customer's expectations- every single time you sell and ship a product.<br />Without customers- you have Nothing
Output:negative
Input:I really love the way they came out! Definitely have to practice before loving your final product though. Everything came in the package like it said it would, all of my gold gems were out of its packaging and all over the place, I had to put them all back one by one, it was tough because they’re really small. But besides that, the products are amazing & my nails look beautiful ❤️
Output:positive
Input:I wore this hair for about a month & a half. When it was shipped to me it was in decent packaging and the hair was extremely soft. After the hair was installed for about 3 weeks it started to SHED to the point I was sweeping everytime I combed my hair out. I managed it by wetting it and just using gel to hold the pattern while it was yet. I would suggest sealing the wefts before installing. I have ordered from the vendor again for Christmas because it wasn’t that bad.

But I finally treated myself.<br />The conditioner arrived in the same box with the shampoo- in a bag only, with the pump already unscrewed and a whole lot of the product already leaked out into the aforementioned bag.<br />The shampoo was in it's own little box inside of the larger box that it was shipped in, not inside of a plastic bag. It did not have it's pump unscrewed, rather the entire life was slightly unscrewed and the shampoo had leaked out all over the bottle, the box and and packaging's entire insides.<br />What poor quality control and customer service- again, $100 worth of product in two bottles!!<br />Absolutely terrible presentation, shipping And quality control.<br />UNACCEPTABLE.<br />Learn to go above and beyond all customer's expectations- every single time you sell and ship a product.<br />Without customers- you have Nothing
Output:negative
Input:I really love the way they came out! Definitely have to practice before loving your final product though. Everything came in the package like it said it would, all of my gold gems were out of its packaging and all over the place, I had to put them all back one by one, it was tough because they’re really small. But besides that, the products are amazing & my nails look beautiful ❤️
Output:positive
Input:I wore this hair for about a month & a half. When it was shipped to me it was in decent packaging and the hair was extremely soft. After the hair was installed for about 3 weeks it started to SHED to the point I was sweeping everytime I combed my hair out. I managed it by wetting it and just using gel to hold the pattern while it was yet. I would suggest sealing the wefts before installing. I have ordered from the vendor again for Christmas because it wasn’t that bad.
Output:positive
Input:Cheap packaging the top was broken, and all the beads fell out all over the floor and made a huge mess.  I ultimately ended up throwing the whole thing out!  It is not worth the price or aggravation!  Save your money!
Output:negative
Input:They were all broken and falling out from the inner packaging.
Output:negative
Input:These lashes are very soft and lightweight. They come off the packaging very easily and they even sent me an additional set for free! I recommend buying this set versus another set as they come with multiple sizes.

Ġlow,Ġcolors,"Input:Looks really good for such a low price, bangs are a smidge shorter than I hoped but it's really cute and the color gradation is lovely and looks like a fancy salon balayage. Minimal shedding and a wide tooth brush goes through pretty easily.
Output:positive
Input:Easy to hold, easy to use, great for beginners who need something easy to figure out comes with a great setup, but I'm not happy with it overall it gets hot in less then 2-3 mins on low speed and keeps stopping.

Input:Had an eye makeup corrector stick from Avon that I'd had for years. It suddenly disappeared. (I suspect that my daughter ""borrowed"" it.) I searched high and low for a replacement, but to no avail. Finally searched on Amazon and found this Maybelline version. It fits the bill. It is more liquid or softer than I'm used to. I like that it has replacement tips. It's larger than my previous pen, but that's okay.
Output:positive
Input:I used this on the caulking around my windows that has mold growing on it. My wife is sensitive to chemicals especially ones containing bleach so I decided to try this. It is less harsh and has low odor however still needs ventilation. Aside from that, it didn’t remove the mold completely after sitting for six hours. I have used other products that worked a lot quicker and more effectively. I have not tested it on any other areas such as the washing machine or grout so I can not speak to how effective it is on those areas.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this item because I wanted to make at home sheet face masks.. the ready made store brands are quite expensive and I thought this would be a cost effective way to do it myself!<br />Honestly, the sheets are nothing like the ready made sheet masks. It has very little, if any stretch so it doesn’t cover the entire face.  The holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth are not great either - again because it doesn’t stretch, my lips were pursed the entire time<br />It is extremely thin. It is not thick at all. It wasn’t even able to retain the toner and serum. As soon as I prepared the sheet to apply it on my face, it wouldn’t stop dripping down my neck. Even after a few tries, it just wouldn’t hold any oils/serums/or creams. Unfortunately, it just didn’t work out.<br />However, the wash cloths were decent. They were quite durable and I use them to wipe off makeup/soap after I wash my face. Again, it’s not thick at all. It’s very very thin, so I have to use 2-3 cloths each time. The fact that they’re dry and wrapped in tiny packaging makes it super convenient. I always carry a few in my purse and spill some water on them to use on my hands, face, or just any surface.<br />The price is low and great, which is why I purchased it... but not worth the money since I couldn’t use it for what I intended.<br />The additional items that came with it were nothing of importance. The headband works quite well, but I would t expect it to last long.

They are clunky and stiff, not to mention don’t even line up correctly.<br /><br />Everything in this kit , down to the thin comb, is unbelievably low quality. I always go with amazon reviews and 99% of the time I think the people who complain got a totally different item than others were reviewing. This  time I feel like I feel like that. This kit is 3x the price of others and terrible quality.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Looks really good for such a low price, bangs are a smidge shorter than I hoped but it's really cute and the color gradation is lovely and looks like a fancy salon balayage. Minimal shedding and a wide tooth brush goes through pretty easily.
Output:positive
Input:Easy to hold, easy to use, great for beginners who need something easy to figure out comes with a great setup, but I'm not happy with it overall it gets hot in less then 2-3 mins on low speed and keeps stopping.
Output:negative
Input:Dome is low, cannot hild regular suze bits even on the bottom row
Output:negative
Input:Had an eye makeup corrector stick from Avon that I'd had for years. It suddenly disappeared. (I suspect that my daughter ""borrowed"" it.) I searched high and low for a replacement, but to no avail. Finally searched on Amazon and found this Maybelline version. It fits the bill. It is more liquid or softer than I'm used to. I like that it has replacement tips. It's larger than my previous pen, but that's okay.
Output:positive
Input:I used this on the caulking around my windows that has mold growing on it. My wife is sensitive to chemicals especially ones containing bleach so I decided to try this. It is less harsh and has low odor however still needs ventilation. Aside from that, it didn’t remove the mold completely after sitting for six hours. I have used other products that worked a lot quicker and more effectively. I have not tested it on any other areas such as the washing machine or grout so I can not speak to how effective it is on those areas.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this item because I wanted to make at home sheet face masks.. the ready made store brands are quite expensive and I thought this would be a cost effective way to do it myself!<br />Honestly, the sheets are nothing like the ready made sheet masks. It has very little, if any stretch so it doesn’t cover the entire face.  The holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth are not great either - again because it doesn’t stretch, my lips were pursed the entire time<br />It is extremely thin. It is not thick at all. It wasn’t even able to retain the toner and serum. As soon as I prepared the sheet to apply it on my face, it wouldn’t stop dripping down my neck. Even after a few tries, it just wouldn’t hold any oils/serums/or creams. Unfortunately, it just didn’t work out.<br />However, the wash cloths were decent. They were quite durable and I use them to wipe off makeup/soap after I wash my face. Again, it’s not thick at all. It’s very very thin, so I have to use 2-3 cloths each time. The fact that they’re dry and wrapped in tiny packaging makes it super convenient. I always carry a few in my purse and spill some water on them to use on my hands, face, or just any surface.<br />The price is low and great, which is why I purchased it... but not worth the money since I couldn’t use it for what I intended.<br />The additional items that came with it were nothing of importance. The headband works quite well, but I would t expect it to last long.
Output:negative
Input:Chalky, low color payoff, use a primer
Output:negative
Input:This brush has only 2 settings...high & low...and neither get hot enough to curl paper.  Look for a professional product with a variable temperature gauge.
Output:negative
Input:A great dryer.  Powerful, smooth operation with extremely low noise. Ask my puppy. I use it mostly for her. My old dryer was a compact and extremely noisy and drove her crazy. This dryer she loves it and allows me to dry her...........
Output:positive
Input:Only giving this low stars because when it arrived smelled very stale. I had to melt the butter and let it air out for a week before I could handle slathering it on my skin.
Output:negative
Input:Bad quality you can broke the brush be tow fingers very low quailty bag

Ġclear,Ġloves,"Input:I had to update my review for after I actually used them.  While I still think these tips are extremely long, they are very easy to cut and shape to your desire.  They're clear which actually makes it nicer and gives you more options for how to paint and style them. They blend with the acrylic very well and look seamless.  I'm happier now that I have used them and they are very strong with the acrylic on them.  Great for the price and lots of sizes to choose from.

Input:Long before ""dermaplaning"" became a popular beauty trend, many women all over the world were using versions of razors like this to clear away their peach fuzz. It gives your makeup a smoother surface to settle on, makes your skin feel nice and soft, etc. I've been buying women's eyebrow razors for this purpose for ages, and those always worked fine, but I wanted to try these because they're bigger and would cover more surface area at once. It turns out that's a blessing AND a curse, as these are a little unwieldy and can be hard to use in spots like the upper lip, chin, and jawline.<br /><br />Also, these are really easy to cut yourself with, so be careful! The guard on them is basically non-existent. Not only is the blade itself sharp, but so is the handle.

Input:This clear coat just comes off and peels off very easily. It is thick which I thought would be good however it just peels off just as much or worse than the thin. The parts that don't peel off get stuck on and wont come off so I have half nails that have a top coat and half of the same nail that has nothing. Very disappointing! It is very shiny and looks nice when first applied! Doesn't last a week though!
Output:negative
Input:This product arrived quickly so shipping wasn't an issue; however, the quality of this makeup is horrible. The pale shades hardly showed at all on my skin, and even after reapplying the shadow multiple times, couldn't tell anything was on my eyes. There were a couple bronze colors in the palette that were pretty and showed well, but they weren't worth keeping the whole palette. The makeup was cheap so I didn't expect much out of it; I consider this a lesson learned. If you're looking for quality or reliable makeup, steer clear of this one.

Input:Ordered 18 in braided on Nov 22, 2018 and it was available for pick up at Amazon Locker in less than 24 hours.  I was impressed and excited  about the purchase of my first lace front wig.  Wig was nicely made.  I removed the combs and added a 1 and a half inch piece of elastic from ear to ear to keep wig tightly secured in place.  I watched you tube videos on how to install and followed the directions by using a stocking cap sprayed with Got2B glue freeze spray from ear to ear in front until completely dry, then I used a seam ripper to cut off excess stocking cap.  Then I put a coat of the clear gel, Got2B glue (black container) on edge from ear to ear.  I let it dry a few minutes until tacky before attaching the lace front to the glue, while brushing the baby hair toward my eyes.  You must work kind of fast to shape your baby hair into the desired pattern because glue dry fast.  I added glue as needed and then tied it down with a scarf until completely dry and hard at the touch.  To finish off, I sprayed alcohol over the front and baby hair and used a cheese cloth to clean up dry gel from face and hair.  I saturate front of wig with alcohol to remove from head and clean off gel from baby hair.  I  paid less than $60 and received many complements and shock when I tell people its a wig .  I  have been able to style the hair  in many ways and keep it in tact for 3-4 days.  I would purchase from this company again.  You will not be disappointed.

Input:This item sucks! The consistency is of far off and it’s extremely hard to work with, after trying many times it doesn’t last long, it lifts in less then 2 days, I’ve been doing nails for years with the clear builder gel and wanted to try this out, it’s useless to thick to work with, no matter how good I prep the nail it still lifts, I’ve tried multiple times. Was a waste of my money
Output:negative
Input:This 3 pack of cream concealer is well, very concealing!  Its thick and maybe that is why it is a challenge to get out of the twist tube every time.  I felt as though I was twisting forever before anything came out and then when it finally did, it wouldn't stop!  It was like an explosion of concealer and it unfortunately seems to do this with every use.  With this concealer, you don't need much of it or it will begin to looked 'caked on"".  I would recommend getting a small container ready to put the extra in before beginning to use it.<br />Because of the 3 pack, you can blend them to match almost any skin tone which is a great feature.  The clear containers also is a great feature too!
Output:positive
Input:Stop!  This product is useless.  One side of the shield has a plastic overlay, which should be removed.  The other side does not.  Once the overlay has been removed one would expect a clear shield.  It is anythings but clear!  I couldn't even read through the fog.  Terrible.
Output:negative
Input:First of all the clear tubes arrived in a ziplock bag like someone off the street buys them in bulk and reaches in bare handed and pulls some out for a ziplock bag.  Gross!!!  Packaging???  What a joke!!!  Cheap, did not shrink wrap well, melt lip balm.  Do not buy these ~ you will not be happy!!  Much better products out there!!

Input:My mother is nearly 80 and used to used this soap years ago because it did not bother her allergies. This time she opened the package and almost had a full asthma attack! The recipe has been changed, and this is absolutely not good soap for people with sensitivities to anything, steer clear... So sorry, Mom :-&lt;

Input:As I find with most clear stampers, they work great at first, then it's hit or miss.  Same with this one, I like it, but the more you push, the stamper shoves up into the handle, you have to pull it back out.  I've used better ones, but this one is ok

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I had to update my review for after I actually used them.  While I still think these tips are extremely long, they are very easy to cut and shape to your desire.  They're clear which actually makes it nicer and gives you more options for how to paint and style them. They blend with the acrylic very well and look seamless.  I'm happier now that I have used them and they are very strong with the acrylic on them.  Great for the price and lots of sizes to choose from.

Input:Long before ""dermaplaning"" became a popular beauty trend, many women all over the world were using versions of razors like this to clear away their peach fuzz. It gives your makeup a smoother surface to settle on, makes your skin feel nice and soft, etc. I've been buying women's eyebrow razors for this purpose for ages, and those always worked fine, but I wanted to try these because they're bigger and would cover more surface area at once. It turns out that's a blessing AND a curse, as these are a little unwieldy and can be hard to use in spots like the upper lip, chin, and jawline.<br /><br />Also, these are really easy to cut yourself with, so be careful! The guard on them is basically non-existent. Not only is the blade itself sharp, but so is the handle. The handle is a pretty sharply-cut material that isn't comfortable to hold at all.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I don't recommend these. You can get better razors for cheaper prices out there.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please click the ""Yes/Helpful"" button below to let me know.

Output:positive
Input:Correction: Even washing doesn't stop the dying from running and ruining your pillow cases. The quality was just okay, the band is not as wide as it is in the picture and a fro barely entirely fits inside of it. Save your money.
Output:negative
Input:I like that is pretty, but the band are too tight on the bottom and on the top. I purchased in December and already the seam came off of a on the bottom I will not ever buy this again.
Output:negative
Input:Would be better if the elastic band could be adjusted. When it is first worn it is too tight, then it stretches out & becomes too loose.<br />It does protect my eye from the air/wind very well.
Output:positive
Input:These lashes are gorgeous! Very fluffy, long and full. You get plenty of pairs for the price and they feel pretty lightweight. If I had to find a flaw with them, I'd say that the lash band is a little bit thick but since I wear liquid eyeliner it is not noticeable when on the eyes.
Output:positive
Input:Not as wide as pictured. The design seems flawed and allows about a half inch of band coverage around your head.
Output:positive
Input:I wear headbands often, sometimes every day. I was looking for some to coordinate with daisy prints or to jazz up a boring outfit. These prints are beautiful. Two daisy prints in the set! However, the material is a slippery polyester which slides across my fine hair, constantly slipping back. To make it worse, they are a tad tight, and I have a fairly small head. I wish they had taken a bit more care to maybe make them a little larger and give something (an elastic band or some gripping material) to the underside, so the headband would stay put. As it is now, they're fairly useless, but I keep pulling them out and wearing them until I realize I've replaced it a million times and take it off entirely. I guess I can just look at them in my collection...
Output:negative
Input:So cute and colorful. Got them for my daughter starting pre-k this year. She loves them! They are good quality, nice thick band and the flowers loop through a sleeve in the bottom of the flower so I'm not worried about the flower falling off. She has very thick hair and these do the trick in keeping her hair up. They don't slide out like most others do by the end of the day, but slide nice when you are ready to take them out. Good purchase!
Output:positive
Input:Very thin band.
Output:negative
Input:I love these Shower Caps. PERFECT size to FIT OVER MY CURLERS when I take a shower! The elastic band lasts well, and is not overly tight -- it is just right! I bought more than one so I would always have one, could take when traveling, etc.

Input:The item arrived very quickly. In addition, it looks & works as advertised. I love the velcro band for the cord. It also heats up very quickly. Excellent quality! Nice design. Very light.

Input:This silk sleeping bonnet was a purchase I was so looking forward to receiving.  I had bought my sister one earlier last month and she loved it!  I decided to get one too.  I ordered this one because I love the pattern and colors.  When I received it I noticed there were a lot more small information packets about the bonnet and how to care for it than what my sister received in her package.  Excited, I pulled the bonnet out to put on before bed and noticed something.  Instead of a nice stretchy elastic draw band, there was a cheap shoelace type draw band.  I slept in it the first night, hoping it would be okay.  The bonnet constantly shifted while I slept and kept coming down over my eyes.  I wore it again the next night, thinking I hadn't tightened the draw band but it was even worse!  The thing came off my head!<br /><br />I decided it wasn't worth returning the product since I had already used it twice on my head.  The thing is, I'm not so much disappointed in the product, but in the false advertisement for this product.  It says an - Silk Bonnet Features with Elastic Thin Bands and Drawstring.  Even the pictures show a convenient elastic drawstring.  My sister has an elastic drawstring that works great!  Not sure why I got no elastic band and only a drawstring.  The cheap nylon drawstring is so thin that tightening it cut into my forehead and the back of my ears.  I paid almost $20 for this thing!  I did order another one and if it doesn't have what the description says it does I'm returning it!

Input:First of all, I'm so  happy to bought so many hair bands at such a low price.<br />But when I received these  product, I was a little disappointed. The ear was two laps smaller than Disney original product  (of course, this was what I expected), but what made me unacceptable was the white glue and strong smell on their ears. It is not recommended that to child wear it for a long time. What is embarrassing is that some of the bows are peeled off when I tap the ear to try to clean the dust. In addition, there are several plastics at the end of the hair band exposed, making this product look very cheap, I picked it a few for the children to play, the rest of the product because I will not share with my  friends.I'm really wanna return it!if possible!

Ġreason,Ġwouldn,"Input:i was going to a con as junko enoshima and when these clips came in i was really sad , they were 10x bigger than the photo and so long for some reason , they completely snapped into pieces , both the clip part and the bears . i dont recommend buying this .
Output:negative
Input:First and foremost, I am upset that I paid almost $200 for this. The hair looks amazing in the packaging but when I cut the lace and put it on, it’s as though the curls dropped IMMEDIATELY. no curls whatsoever. Not only that, but a piece in the front looks so fried, it’s as if it was burnt during the dying process and they didn’t bother to fix it. It does not look good straight because of all the straggly split ends.<br />I do give it props for taking a curl...and lasting for only  almost an hour.<br />I am absolutely disappointed and will not recommend.<br />Only reason it’s getting two stars is because the hair is soft. But that and the color is the only things going for it.
Output:negative
Input:Well no reason to get into the plunger which we all know is useless but the packaging was good and no breaks. I was using Meaningful beauty and it made my face a greasy mess! I found this after searching for dark spot help. Since i turned 38 i have noticed dark looking spots on the top of my cheekbones. Im sure its from years of outdoor sun and tanning bed periodically in my 20s. Really didnt care about the long term effects. Now im dealing with that and redness on my entire face. I've been using this for about 3 days now after a shower when my pores are opened. I can't say i have seen any results yet but of course its too soon. I can tell you that this does not leave my face oily at all! Skin feels cool and dry after immediate use. I really hope this works for me. I really wouldn't care how much it costs as long as it works but the price is awesome! I will update after 1 month. I didnt realize you need to use it 2 times daily so i will start with that tomorrow. High hopes!

Input:This product was nothing like the reviews I read.  For some reason, it burned my eyelids and, worse, it actually caused my eyelashes to fall out in places and my eyelashes became very short and stubby.  Threw it away after 6 weeks and ordered Latisse because it actually works!
Output:negative

Input:There are several professional piercing parlors near me, but for some reason, I never seemed to get to one, and I very much wanted my ears pierced. I finally bought these piercing guns, and within two minutes, my ears were pierced. No problems whatsoever. They earrings are in now and my ears are healing well.

If you want something other than the lobe of the ear pierced, I would recommend a professional, but for the lobe, they are great!

Input:I garden a lot and started using clear nail polish these days ... not pretty what can end up under nails. The reason I must write a review about this simple everyday product is because I searched CVS and other drug stores and they did Not have it.

Output:positive
Input:I really love the quality and the variety of colors that came with this package the only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because it is a little difficult to get it to attach to my hair I have thicker hair and it's really curly so it's hard to type anything in and out around it but all in all a great product that I would buy again
Output:positive
Input:Everyone comments on the smell of this putty, and it DOES smell very nice.<br />However, that is not the reason I would buy hair products. I purchase for the shine and the hold.<br />As advertised, this is a medium shine, medium hold putty.<br />It goes in nice and thick/sticky and holds well throughout the day. It looks more natural, not like you gooped a bunch of gel in your hair. This brand is new to me, but it is performing well so far, and I would recommend giving it a try!
Output:positive
Input:These, while pretty if they weren't broken, came in pieces.  Most rhinestones were missing w glue in its place.  The only reason I'm not returning is because I need them this week and I have rhinestones to glue on myself.  I have to sew the front back to the side it was glued to.  Not seen at all.
Output:negative
Input:When i first received my airbrush, for some reason i didn't like it. a month later i gave it a second shot and now i love it! I use it everyday for a nice natural look, or you can apply more to make it full coverage. all my friends use it and love it too!

Ġsomething,Ġtravel,"Input:Honestly great, it's long, doesn't tangle easily, and I don't have any trouble putting it on. I've worn this out (with a hat) and no one questioned if it was real or not. It is thin and when separating it into parts you can see its cap but that is kinda expected for the price. Overall, if you want something cheap that you can wear out (under some restrictions) it's a good purchase. (It should be noted I am relatively skinny and it does feel heavy but not to the point where I can't function)
Output:positive
Input:Like the first reviewer, I too was not aware that this wasn't the product I've used for years. Doesn't cover like a solid, doesn't spread like a liquid... it's the worst of both worlds. I can't stand this stuff. I made the mistake of buying six, and used the first one only about three days until I had a chance to go buy something else. Definitely a purchase I regret.
Output:negative
Input:This wig is so beautiful! It has little to no shine and no hair fallout. It is soft and great for styling. The hair at the end is a slightly lighter blonde than the hair at the top, which makes it look very realistic and pretty. I bought this wig for my Panty Anarchy cosplay, and I recommend it to other Panty cosplayers as well as those who are cosplaying something else. :)
Output:positive
Input:I purchased this a year and a half ago, and when it worked it curled my hair fast and they stayed. However, it started shorting out over a month ago and when I contacted customer service, they told me it basically was out of their hands because it was out of the warranty time (1 year). If this was a $30-$50 curling iron I would be like ok. But considering the cost of this curling iron, I expected better quality. It shouldn’t short out in less than 2 years. Save yourself some money and invest in something other than Beachwaver.
Output:negative
Input:I know it's a risk to buy this kind of item, and this one is the best example of what you hope NOT to get.<br /><br />I have a few of these in a medium brown, and nobody has ever noticed they were fake hair. (not from this seller/manufacturer)<br />This one, however, is not one that could ever pull off looking natural, even if your hair color matched perfectly.<br /><br />The quality of the hair and the elastic is good, there's lots of hair and it looks as pictured.<br />The color and look of the actual hair is cheap; it's unnaturally shiny - not even a quality glosser would get your hair like this!<br />This is something I will wear to a white-trash costume party.
Output:negative
Input:I like this cause it is in stick form instead of liquid. It is just suncreen, don't let the word &#34;tattoo&#34; let you think it is something different, any sunscreen stick will do. Travels well.
Output:positive
Input:This hair is rough straight out of the package and it doesn’t even feel like human hair it’s a blend! . I would appreciate for those who are selling hair on Amazon stop putting the description as 100% HUMAN HAIR when it is not thank you ! Now I cannot get my hair done and have to re order something els
Output:negative
Input:I like this formula enough for cleaning my skin. It's completely soy-free which is something that is surprisingly hard to find in skincare. Cleans skin well and doesn't really have a scent to it at all. My big grievance with this product is that it's so runny and has no business coming in a squeeze tube. As soon as you open the cap it starts drizzling out which is a waste of product and messy. Would not revisit this product again unless they change the packaging.
Output:negative
Input:It was cheap looking. It isn't for Black women unless you very light skinned. I buy this color blend but something about texture.
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited to find a somewhat upgrade to my old toothbrush when I got this. It came with all the extra items listed and looked nice at first glance. I barely used this product for about a week and its already falling apart. After a few uses it started cracking and pieces were falling off of the body, the replaceable bristle head attachments got disconnected and the neck of the bristle got stuck to the connector, the bristles themselves fell out in clumps when I brushed once and had to pick bristles out of my teeth after that use. I have never encountered this many issues with a toothbrush before and if you're thinking of getting this, don't waste your time. Go find something else.
Output:negative
Input:I ordered this because I saw something similar on QVC and this was much cheaper with all the attachments - rollers (8 file rollers and 9 smooth ones).  I also have Amazon Prime so the free shipping was really a plus compared to QVC.  Also, if I didn't like it, I could always return it for a full refund.  I wanted to try it because I'm older and my nails have lots of ridges.  This definitely takes care of those.  Using this also makes your polish go on much smoother.  This is really easy to use on your finger nails.  I have a hard time on my toe nails because I really can't reach my feet very well so I've decided to let my nail salon pedicure take care of my toes.<br /><br /> I've had this now for about 6 months and it works as good as new.  I'm using the same batteries and luckily, the rollers lasts thru numerous uses.  I just started my second file roller.  The shine roller lasts much longer.  I really like the carry-bag that comes with it as it allows me to take it with me on trips.<br /><br />I love this so much that I'm ordering two more - one for my daughter and one for my sister for Christmas.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F7JMBNM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4?th=1
Output:positive
Input:This product hurt my skin, made it dry and I for a burn on my face from use it, I was expecting something good and at the end it hurt my skin so bad. I don't recommend this at all.
Output:negative
Input:These fit like a hat rather than something I can get my shoulder length hair into.
Output:negative
Input:This is good if you don’t have an especially long beard. My beard is a little too long for the short teeth on this comb. I also discovered that something with this comb irritates my skin. I bought this because it was less expensive than the one I got from “Rapid Beard”
Output:negative
Input:I’m so happy that I found a solution to my makeup woes. My makeup was housed in three different makeup bags. Rolling around, powder everywhere, occasional liquid leaks. A ball of confusion.<br />This bag houses all of my makeup collection with space to grow. The case is sturdy and the zippers are quality. It is rigid enough to protect the contents if something is stacked on it. I’m buying another 2 cases for my nail care, hair care and maybe another for my skincare tools.

I have a hard time on my toe nails because I really can't reach my feet very well so I've decided to let my nail salon pedicure take care of my toes.<br /><br /> I've had this now for about 6 months and it works as good as new.  I'm using the same batteries and luckily, the rollers lasts thru numerous uses.  I just started my second file roller.  The shine roller lasts much longer.  I really like the carry-bag that comes with it as it allows me to take it with me on trips.<br /><br />I love this so much that I'm ordering two more - one for my daughter and one for my sister for Christmas.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F7JMBNM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4?th=1

Input:This product hurt my skin, made it dry and I for a burn on my face from use it, I was expecting something good and at the end it hurt my skin so bad. I don't recommend this at all.
Output:negative
Input:These fit like a hat rather than something I can get my shoulder length hair into.
Output:negative
Input:This is good if you don’t have an especially long beard. My beard is a little too long for the short teeth on this comb. I also discovered that something with this comb irritates my skin. I bought this because it was less expensive than the one I got from “Rapid Beard”
Output:negative
Input:I’m so happy that I found a solution to my makeup woes. My makeup was housed in three different makeup bags. Rolling around, powder everywhere, occasional liquid leaks. A ball of confusion.<br />This bag houses all of my makeup collection with space to grow. The case is sturdy and the zippers are quality. It is rigid enough to protect the contents if something is stacked on it. I’m buying another 2 cases for my nail care, hair care and maybe another for my skincare tools.

Ġquite,Ġcould,"Input:These are the nicest looking lashes I've gotten.  They are quite natural looking.  I've tried a couple of other sets and they have all looked like hairy caterpillars.  In terms of whether they're easy to apply, I'm guessing it takes practice.  The tweezers provided are decent.  I do not find them easy to apply but they arent any harder (or easier)  than other similar sets.  I'm starting to think I'm just terrible at it.
Output:positive
Input:Smell and feeling is great. Not quite the long lasting absorbing power as the good ole Gold bond.. but no cancer causing stuff either. So a good dry lube for your giblet area and armpits if you travel in humid areas - I live in Savannah so.... always Humid.  Seriously though, smells great and has this menthol invigorating feeling that's similar to a fan blowing on the goods. I put the gold bond medicated cooling powder on my freshly shaved eggs twice and it was like dropping them into boiling water. Burned. Took the wind out of me both times. This stuff though, same cooling feeling... none of the regret and crying. Just simply refreshing and dry. Will be taking Fromonda on my trip to Nicaragua for thanksgiving. Good Stuff.
Output:positive
Input:Bought it for husband who travels quite some. He loves the fragrance itself and the silver case. 2hat you should know. The package will have 3 exactly same tiny sprays, only 1 will be inside the travel metal casing. You cannot refill with anything but specifically designed Prada little bottles. This metal casing is super heavy. It's a VERY heavy little piece, that kinda cancels the purpose of it.<br />Also, the cap in this silverish casing is loose. Falls off easily, it should be tighter. I only give it 5 stars because my husband is ecstatic. As a woman, I would give 3 stars for incompatibility, weight and loose cap.
Output:positive
Input:They're quite a few of these hair dryers popping up that are designed to look like the ridiculously expensive Dyson. While I've never tried the Dyson, I was excited by the design and so I picked this one up. On the plus side it does have an extremely long cord so if you can't stand right directly next to you anymore you'll be fine but it is not a swivel cord so it's not as maneuverable as others. It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do. And I just have to go back to the overall style and design again because this hair dryer looks so sleek and cool. I get a kick out of using it every time I see it.
Output:positive
Input:Not quite like I thought it'd be. Leaves my face soft but not sure if it removes the blackheads.
Output:negative
Input:I have been using this product for 2-3 years already. I felt the smooth skin like baby face at the first try. But it could take some time like my sister took a few times of try during one month to feel the same. I liked the old way - with cream and sponge puff, but the cream dries if you don't finish the whole bottle in a quite short period of time. The new way - the disposable puff refills are good to use for a long time, but sometimes I have hard time because it has too much water (tried to wet with small amount of water, but didn't really work), especially when I use it lying down. This is better than the expensive spa service if you're deligent enough.
Output:positive
Input:Very high quality! I have purchased quite a number of organizers of this type and have to say that this one appears the most expensive and elegant of all. Also seems to be extremely sturdy and happened to the perfect size for what I wanted it for!
Output:positive
Input:About as thick as bath and body works mens products, lathers up quite well, isn't hard to pump. Rough math says I'll get 24 showers out of a bottle so not bad.

Input:K, so you hold your hair up and do a little bun type thing with one hand. Then with the other hand you open up the hair clip and clip your hair. That’s how I do it at least…. Can’t do that with these as they require two hands to open, lol. I tried so hard. And I do not have small hands for a women. My hands are actually quite large for a women and I’m fairly strong. The way these are made is just stupid. No idea if they fall apart as I returned them as soon as I realized I can’t put them in my hair.
Output:negative
Input:I like how quickly the product arrived. Not only did it arrive fast, but the packaging was really good. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I've been able to try two to three colors. They are super pigmented, didn't required too many coats to look good, cured really fast and stayed on for quite a good minute.<br /><br />I've been trying to wear my real nails for a while now and haven't been able to find a good gel that stays on and looks nice. However, this one is really good
Output:positive
Input:I got this beard comb for my boyfriend and he really enjoys it! The more he uses it the more fluffy and smooth his beard looks. It’s also quite sturdy! It fell off the counter into hardwood floors and surprisingly didn’t even get a scratch! Love this product.
Output:positive
Input:There is no peculiar smell, the elastic band is very suitable, it can tightly wrap the hair, and it will not feel squeezed, and the size is right. Generally speaking, the shower cap is good and the practical quality is quite good.
Output:positive
Input:This Kakyoin wig does it’s job and is easy to style. I did have to trim it quite a bit to match the length of his hair, but the wig is thick enough and a really nice color
Output:positive
Input:This works amazingly!!!! You do need to let it soak for quite a few if you want your shellac to just come off. I did my left hand first and let it sit for maybe 3 mins and then wiped it off and picked it off with my other hand and it came right off, I did have to reapply to a few nails. So on my right hand i waited longer and it came off without having to reapply and my nails AREN'T RUINED 😁😁
Output:positive
Input:I love CANTU hair products, so thought I'd give it a shot. It is very moisturizing, but also quite fragrant, which, had it been noted on the bottle, would have made me not purchase it. It's not a bad smell, just very strong for a full body lotion.
Output:negative
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:These are the nicest looking lashes I've gotten.  They are quite natural looking.  I've tried a couple of other sets and they have all looked like hairy caterpillars.  In terms of whether they're easy to apply, I'm guessing it takes practice.  The tweezers provided are decent.  I do not find them easy to apply but they arent any harder (or easier)  than other similar sets.  I'm starting to think I'm just terrible at it.
Output:positive
Input:Smell and feeling is great. Not quite the long lasting absorbing power as the good ole Gold bond.. but no cancer causing stuff either. So a good dry lube for your giblet area and armpits if you travel in humid areas - I live in Savannah so.... always Humid.  Seriously though, smells great and has this menthol invigorating feeling that's similar to a fan blowing on the goods. I put the gold bond medicated cooling powder on my freshly shaved eggs twice and it was like dropping them into boiling water. Burned. Took the wind out of me both times. This stuff though, same cooling feeling... none of the regret and crying. Just simply refreshing and dry. Will be taking Fromonda on my trip to Nicaragua for thanksgiving. Good Stuff.
Output:positive
Input:Bought it for husband who travels quite some. He loves the fragrance itself and the silver case. 2hat you should know. The package will have 3 exactly same tiny sprays, only 1 will be inside the travel metal casing. You cannot refill with anything but specifically designed Prada little bottles. This metal casing is super heavy. It's a VERY heavy little piece, that kinda cancels the purpose of it.<br />Also, the cap in this silverish casing is loose. Falls off easily, it should be tighter. I only give it 5 stars because my husband is ecstatic. As a woman, I would give 3 stars for incompatibility, weight and loose cap.
Output:positive
Input:They're quite a few of these hair dryers popping up that are designed to look like the ridiculously expensive Dyson. While I've never tried the Dyson, I was excited by the design and so I picked this one up. On the plus side it does have an extremely long cord so if you can't stand right directly next to you anymore you'll be fine but it is not a swivel cord so it's not as maneuverable as others. It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do. And I just have to go back to the overall style and design again because this hair dryer looks so sleek and cool. I get a kick out of using it every time I see it.
Output:positive
Input:Not quite like I thought it'd be. Leaves my face soft but not sure if it removes the blackheads.
Output:negative
Input:I have been using this product for 2-3 years already. I felt the smooth skin like baby face at the first try. But it could take some time like my sister took a few times of try during one month to feel the same. I liked the old way - with cream and sponge puff, but the cream dries if you don't finish the whole bottle in a quite short period of time. The new way - the disposable puff refills are good to use for a long time, but sometimes I have hard time because it has too much water (tried to wet with small amount of water, but didn't really work), especially when I use it lying down. This is better than the expensive spa service if you're deligent enough.
Output:positive
Input:Very high quality! I have purchased quite a number of organizers of this type and have to say that this one appears the most expensive and elegant of all. Also seems to be extremely sturdy and happened to the perfect size for what I wanted it for!
Output:positive
Input:About as thick as bath and body works mens products, lathers up quite well, isn't hard to pump. Rough math says I'll get 24 showers out of a bottle so not bad.

Ġprice,Ġan,"Input:I absolutely love this hair. Very fast shipping. Ive received so many compliments! Great price for the length as well.Good quality hair and closure.No shedding at all. Hair is soft, Colour is accurate and there is no smell. Hair is thick from weft to end. Hair is true to length.
Output:positive
Input:This is a great product. Great price for 2 bottles and the cucumber scent is wonderful. A nice light lotion for the summer time but certainly will keep your skin moisturized during the cooler months.
Output:positive
Input:This deodorant certainly does NOT last 24 hours. I feel like I had to reapply it every two hours. This crap was $8 damn dollars! I would expect something at that price to at least keep me smelling good for my 9 hour work day.
Output:negative
Input:I have super short fried from bleaching hair and it just doesn’t grow . These extensions were exactly the color of bleached hair , they blend very well and were very easy to use. I wish there was more in the pack for the price but I am not disappointed
Output:positive
Input:I loooooooooooove this brush!!!! It is definetly worth the purchase. I have long thick hair and I dont even need to use it on the highest setting. I can straighten my hair in half the time it takes me to flat iron it.<br /><br />I would recommend this hands down. I will be posting pictures soon :)<br /><br />I did get a discount for this item but I would pay full price. The customer service is unbelievable too!
Output:positive
Input:The quality of these tattoos is amazing. They make me feel sexy when i wear them out in the town. It goes great with black dresses. I received many complaints from my friends. I will defiantly recommend to family and friends.  I received this product for a discounted price for my honest unbiased review,
Output:positive
Input:You get a whole lot of clips that help you create different hairstyles. I have a ton of hair and when styling need to separate my hair into many sections...the quality is good enough for the price they do bend a bit but don't break easily which is a plus for me.
Output:positive
Input:Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.
Output:positive
Input:I love the color of the bottles and all the things that came with it. The price is okay but my problem is the fact that I love to spray more than once but the sprayer will only goes one time and it doesn't retract on its own. I have not tried the others yet, I hope they're not all like this.
Output:positive
Input:This is very very amazing. Definitely worth the price! I used it and it left my hair soft and stayed curled all night. I highly recommend this product. Heats up fast and definitely does its job! Buy it(:
Output:positive
Input:Definitely worth it for the price for amount you get. You would pay that for 1 at Walmart
Output:positive
Input:Much cheaper elsewhere. I just didn't have time to research best price so I let myself get ripped off. The product is great as always. The price was insanely high comparatively. Again however. The product is as always great. Been using it for years..
Output:negative
Input:Just spending money. The price doesn’t worth
Output:negative
Input:I like these better than the OEM brushes, and at much lower price.  Will buy again when the time comes.
Output:positive
Input:Good price
