It also has a hard plastic ‚Äúcinch stopper‚Äù buckle thing (like what‚Äôs on your windbreaker) that lets you tighten the elastic, which is a cool concept but is painful to sleep on.

Input:I want my money back. I believe i am receiving knock off product. The stuff i buy at store works very well. Not only did this not hold my hair, the bottle is slightly different when compared side by side. Buyer beware!
Output:negative
Input:This product works for my mother but not for me. While its great for her it leaves my hair looking and feeling greasy. Softee is not for everyone but it depends on your hair type. I would recomend it for people with a corser hair type. On the plus side it is natural unlike some products today.

Input:After reading all of the bad reviews on this new Norelco shaver, I swore I was not going to buy this unit.<br /><br />Well, a few months ago I realized my local stores didn't stock my HQ5 Norelco replacement blades anymore and I about had a heart attack. Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.<br /><br />I have had a Norelco 5885XL for the past 13 years. I love this unit and it suits me well. This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.<br /><br />Here is my 1050x review.. it was painful to write, but here goes..<br /><br />--This is a noisy shaver folks.. I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH? This is not good. I simply cannot accept a noisy shaver. This thing is inches away from my ears at 5am and that is very annoying. I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.<br /><br />--What a bad shave. Starting with a 2-day shadow growth, I shaved half of my face with my trusty 5885XL [using 1.5 year old blades] and the other half with my shiny new 1050x unit. I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn't being overly critical of my new toy.<br /><br />As I suspected, she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.<br /><br />As I shaved with the 1050x, I realized that I was going over the same growth areas without making things smoother, especially around the neck.  I was getting tired, frustrated, and irritated. The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.<br /><br />--Here come the skin irritations: Ahhh!!!<br />Just a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was]. Having used Norelcos all of my shaving life, about 25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn't. no thanks..<br /><br />--Bad charging system!  What the heck is it with this terrible charging system. I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel. The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?! I can see this cable being the 1st thing I lose on a business trip because it does not have a place to be stored.<br /><br />Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver. I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong. Sadly, they are correct in every way.<br /><br />My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco's older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide. Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90's IMHO.<br /><br />Norelco, come'on buddy.. Your losing me big time here.<br /><br />It's back to my 5885xl, and I have found my HQ5's here on Amazon, clicking buy; and it's byebye to my 1050x.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />F.

Input:I love the quality of Becca products and these are no exception. This is such a gorgeous and unique palette that I had to purchase a pan at my local Sephora store. The shade I bought is the Champagne Pop / Flowerchild and it compliments my medium beige skin.<br /><br />I find that my brushes pick up the right amount of blush and highlight so it's buildable which is how I like to apply makeup - it's easier to add on than to remove product. It gives my face a beautiful natural glow. I have read some reviews that the blush is a bit on the dry side but in my opinion, the more you use it, the consistency gets better. You just have to pretty much go through the top layer and then you will notice that the brush will pick up more pigment and it will feel more buttery.<br /><br />Below are some images I've added including some thick swatches.<br /><br />The case looks so elegant and expensive. This pan is super convenient as I don't have to carry around a blush &amp; highlighter separately which is also a bonus when I am travelling.<br /><br />I believe this is a limited edition so if you want to splurge on a unique palette, buy it!<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful! :-)

Input:Honestly, I wasn't 100% sure on how well this would work when I got it... I was definitely on the skeptical side, until I used it. Holy crap, this thing is impressive! It cleaned my brushes so well, that they looked BRAND NEW. I am totally in love with this mat, even the little hand held one works fantastic! Especially for the smaller brushes. I also think it's cute that it comes with a small beauty blender sponge. All around great purchase, no regrets!!!

Output:negative
Input:For starters let me just say i was iffy about getting these, because i dont like when the balls are on the bigger side.. and most the time when i order online they are to big. These were perfect size!!! true 16g!! The colors are great the shipping was fast. my only complaint was that there was 36 instead of 40. I even double counted and had my friends count them to make sure i wasnt messing up. lol  As for people saying the balls break quick, try not screwing them on so tight. there not metal it splits them. that was a problem of mine for the longest time. Now mine last soo much longer! GL
Output:positive
Input:This is small, cheap looking, too hard and not worth the price (very overpriced). I would send it back but not worth my time. I will use it as an extra most likely. Calling one side of it a brush is a misnomer in how I think of a brush's bristles being softer.
Output:negative
Input:So, essences have always been a bit of a mystery to me (and, honestly, seemed like hokum) but my curiosity always led me back to research them. I've even bought them over the years and abandoned them because I just didn't know how to use them or if they were working. (And these are other best sellers with high price tags.) I finally revisited essences, caved in, and bought this super seller just to see if there was a fuss to be made over it. There is.<br /><br />The very first time I applied it, I had a minor healing blemish on my cheekbone and it tingled at that spot. (Cool, it's not just water, lol.) I applied all my other stuff and knew it at least imparted moisture - my skin felt supple and hydrated. I noticed a change after just about a week using this - my skin was more even, a bit smoother (I have roughness on my cheeks that never seems to go away, no matter what), and dewy. I went camping for a few days - the dirty kind - and, after neglecting it, my skin needed help. I noticed everything bounced back much faster than it ordinarily would. I typically get a breakout after a trip like that but my skin stayed clear, it was just rough and sallow. Once home and finished with my usual routine, everything was back to normal and radiant again.<br /><br />I know there are conflicting thoughts on how best to apply it; I won't put it on a cotton pad as I feel that would just waste too much product. (I first used this on May 6th and the picture is from 3 days ago - that's ALL I've used in about a month.) Right now I'm using one little drip of product for my whole face and neck; I just pour it in my hand, pat my hands together, and apply to a slightly damp face after toner. I must be experiencing what people are describing as a &#34;water burst,&#34; because I put that tiny amount on my face and it's like I'm splashing water from a running faucet, that's the only way I can think to describe it; like the amount of wetness I'm getting exceeds the amount of product I used. I'm going to put some in a spray bottle with a fine-mist nozzle and use it that way, which is also how I'm going to travel with it. (Though, I've traveled with this large bottle and it's never leaked - and it lays on its side in my bag.)<br /><br />For the price and the small amount I use, I will absolutely be repurchasing this.<br />(For reference, my once very-oily skin became dry then combo over this last winter, and now it's back to moderately oily, so it runs the gamut. I also have some unevenness, roughness on my cheeks, and dullness - all of which are improving everyday, and even my one or two monthly hormonal blemishes have been minimal and, if I get any small breakout, it's gone in a day or two and never fully forms to begin with.)<br /><br />Update 10/23/17: the 2nd picture is from last night; more than 5 months of daily use (sometimes twice a day)<br />Update 4/12/18: the 3rd picture is from last night - May 6th will be a year since I bought this bottle and I still have about 1/4 left. (Sorry, can't get those pictures upright no matter what.)

Output:positive
Input:For the most part these lashes are pretty great, especially for the price. They look great on, they stay on, and they‚Äôre not difficult to apply. Honestly will probably never switch back to regular glue on lashes. I‚Äôve tried different magnetic lashes and these are by far my favorite. The little magnets haven‚Äôt broken off and I‚Äôve been able to rewear them quite a bit. Only problems I had with these is the glue is a pain to take off, and is super sticky if you get it on your tweezers. Same thing if you get the glue in the lashes, it takes a bit to clean it out. If this happens , do not try wiping it out of the lashes while it‚Äôs still wet. It makes it worse lol. As for taking the liner off , It will ball up and smear across your skin. I guess it‚Äôs not THAT big of a deal as long as you have a good makeup remover and patience. But just a heads up that it takes some work to get off. But on the bright side, that just means they hold up well and will stay on throughout your time wearing them! Don‚Äôt let my cautions daunt you from buying them! They really are great lashes and they‚Äôre a great addition to any makeup look. :)

ƒ†stopped,ƒ†pay,"Input:I had a drill exactly like this, I believe it was the same one for over a year so when it stopped working I ordered this one expecting to get another year or so out of it, it stopped working in the middle of my second use. I will be returning this and looking for a new e-file.
Output:negative
Input:Good quality. The only reason I rated 4 stars is because the scent is very similar to men's shaving cream and men's soap and shampoo products. I have stopped using it, because I don't want my hair to smell like a man's product. That's my only complaint.
Output:positive
Input:I stopped drawing in my brows. My brow makeup used to take me 10 min, where the rest of my face took me 3-5?? Now I just tint every 5-7 days.<br /><br />My daily routine is literally now 3-5 min. Amazing.
Output:positive
Input:The item stopped working after 2 months and can't be returned
Output:negative
Input:After only a few months, with minimal use, this dryer started making a very strange, loud grinding noise. When smoke started coming from it, I turned it off, unplugged it and stopped using it before it likely was about to explode in my face! I'm now going to take advantage of the supposed one year warranty that it came with and get a refund. Very bad product.

Input:I did not like the mask at all...my face got irritated and it was red...i am allergic to the mask i don't like it at all it was horrible...I gave it about a week then I noticed that it was getting worse so I stop wearing the mask...as soon as I stopped wearing the dryness and irritation went away...will never by anything like this again...
Output:negative
Input:Honestly didn't seem like the ion feature did anything, and a few days after getting it, the brush piece that comes out for access to the batteries stopped staying it.  Wouldn't latch in anymore.  Returned for refund.
Output:negative
Input:At first it was quite promising, easy to use but Just a 4 days of using it stopped working.

Input:I got it put it on the charger and started buffing my nails after a few hours of it being on the charger. Shortly after before even completing my second hand it stopped working.
Output:negative
Input:This spray bottle worked great for about two months and then the spray stopped working correctly as a mist. It still sprays, but I paid extra for this specific spray and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. DON‚ÄôT BUY!!! It will not last long and is too expensive.

Input:Thank God for such a product for genetically hair-challenged women. After experiencing gradual hair loss for years, this product helps me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. The topper made of real hair is beautiful, soft and not too thick (I have fine hair and it blends in). It is so easy and painless to clip on...and this is my first time using such a product. The color is a true soft black, but darker than my bio hair, which is black with strands of white/gray. I figured out a way to blend my bio hair by combing it over the supplemental hair. As other reviewers said, this topper is not a lot of hair (hence the price point) but it works to cover my thinning hair part and back of crown. The topper is also not overwhelming - just enough hair to subtly supplement my bio hair without people noticing a drastic change.

Input:This make-up organizer exceeded my expectations, it's absolutely beautiful and has all the right compartments. I did a lot of research on several rolling organizers and finally decided to go for this one, I had no idea what to expect and when I first opened the package I knew this was going to be worth every penny. I would highly recommend this particular one to anyone who is looking for something stylish and most importantly - usable! I can put so much stuff in this and one thing I didn't know was that the inside walls are interchangable so you can customize it to fit your personal belongings.<br />I could go on forever about this organizer, I'm completely in-love with it!!

Input:Beautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again.

Input:Awesome top coat have been using it for over a year but I do not like the new bottle. It is hard to store.
Output:positive
Input:The inner rings were all broken and the ends of the comb to do appear to have been filed down and look very jagged around the edges. I thought that this was supposed to be a hard rubber comb, but it looks and feels like the one I can purchase at a beauty supply store except for the added metal bar that is at the base of the prongs, this could lead to extreme heat damage on the hair because it is not reported what kind of metal the bar is and how hot it can get.<br />I am very disappointed and will be attempting to return this product.
Output:negative
Input:I‚Äôm not sure this is 100% human hair it had various strings in it (see pics) as well as some clear plastic ones. Before install there was a good amount of shedding by just running my fingers through the hair to fluffen it. Which brings me to my next point, the hair was really crunchy and hard when it first arrived which leads me to believe it may have been processed to the color and curl pattern its currently in (its a jet black color). There is some sort of film that can be felt on the hair and it makes your hands feel as though they‚Äôre covered in something and the hair has a beauty supply store smell to it. Wefts were thick and easy to sew through. I cut my wefts so I have lots of additional shedding. Now I havent done anything to this hair but throw some water on it some days and the while the curls have gotten flat, they havent fell nor had its lost its move and body. I wet it thoroughly and the curls returned to their original shape. I was going to try and color it but since I believe its been processed I dont want to take the chance and have It become nappy and unmanageable. I havent added any type of product to the hair because I dont want it to lose its body, luster and shine. I‚Äôve only had it installed for about a week so if it happens to turn into a crows nest within the next couple weeks (I ususally keep my sew ins for three to four weeks) I‚Äôll update my review. Any questions let me know!<br /><br />Update 12/3/18- DEFINITELY been processed. I used my mizano chelating and neutralizing shampoo to wash and water turned colored as if black dye was being washed out. Curls still come back to life when they fall or become flat. Maintains bounce regardless of how long I dont comb it. I dont ANY product in this hair, afraid it may ruin it.
Output:positive
Input:Where have the original and best small clips gone? Seems they've been replaced by these. I have medium fine hair that the original clips are perfect in. These- the prongs are too widely spaced to work, at least for me. I was able to pull them right out of my hair without opening them. I donated these to a thrift store and hope someone else will have better luck with them. If it's not broke don't try to ""fix"" it!!!
Output:negative
Input:Myy beauty supply store never has the color hair I want so I ordered this. The color is beautiful... exactly as pictured. I gave 4 stars because the packs are smaller than usual and I did have some tangling while  installing my box braids.
Output:positive
Input:I purchased this dryer late June 2020 because the other dryer I already have like this was unavailable for a few months, and we needed another dyer after growing our staff. The heating element has already gone out. We've been tolerant of an intermittent rattle in the fan when the cool air/warm air buttons are selected, BUT once the heating element went out, it's just large and in the way. You HAVE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURE to assist in the warranty issues and THERE IS NO CONTACT INFO FOR THE MANUFACTURE listed in the Amazon listing, their ""store page"", or in the assembly info sent with the dryer. Purchase at your own risk. I highly suggest investing in a higher quality machine from a store with a reputation.

Input:I‚Äôve always used the glue kind of lashes before but I never really could get the hang of it & they never stayed on long enough. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever tried the magnetic kind & I love love love them! Maybe it‚Äôs the brand because my daughter hated the kind I got her in a store years ago, she couldn‚Äôt get them to stay but I‚Äôm going to get her this kind so she can see how great they are! I literally wear mine for 2 days straight. That‚Äôs even sleeping in them! Now I can only do that with 2 coats of liner, especially at the corners, but that‚Äôs no big deal. 2 quick coats, 3 minutes for it to get nice & tacky & then the eyelashes! Bam 1,2, 3 done! The part that takes me forever is deciding which pair to wear because every pair is nice & bold & just beautiful! I don‚Äôt need extra liner or any mascara. Pretty much all I need to do is throw some shadow in my creases, dab on some lipstick & a touch of something for the cheeks & im ready to go for any event. I also can just dab on some lipgloss & go. Nothing else, no fuss. Taking of the lashes are easier than with the glue & the liner comes off with some oil on a Q-Tip (I don‚Äôt like oil on my face due to sensitive skin so i localize it with the Q-tip). I really haven‚Äôt found anything wrong with the lashes at all & I've wore 4 different pairs now over a 10 day period.

Input:All 5 nano misters came in individual boxes.  I took them all out and tested all of them.  I'm really surprised on the output of these misters.  I had one I bought at a store and these spray out 4 times the mist.  They work great!  ATM I just fill them with distilled water and use it to refresh ourselves when it's dry.  It really gives a nice cooling effect!
Output:positive
Input:This conditioner is just meh for me. I was excited because it is full of natural oils but there are no ingredients on the bottle, which is suspect. I have been using it for a few weeks with a marked decrease in the smoothness of my hair and increased frizziness. It works about as well as regular cheap store conditioner, but it definitely doesn't perform like high end conditioner, or even Pantene. I will probably finish up this bottle because I don't like to waste things, but I wouldn't buy this again and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. The good thing about it is that it smells nice and it comes in a very big pump dispenser. If I could be more confident in the ingredients I would feel more comfortable with this product in general.<br /><br />I got this conditioner for free in order to try it out and review it. This is obviously my honest opinion, I didn't care for it much.
Output:negative
Input:These washcloths are far superior to the puff balls since this can be used for cleaning my back. They last forever, until you get annoyed with the slight fraying on the sides, but at this price, who cares. They wash out easily and dry in no time.<br />I used to have to go to the Japanese store to buy them but am happy to get them online now.
Output:positive
Input:This hair is terrible! The way it arrived is how it looks in the picture until it was uncoiled. The hair is very thin and lifeless. It resembles the quality of synthetic hair that one would find in a discount bin at your local hair store. This hair was in and out of my head within the same day. This hair isn't even sufficient for a quick hair style that you only want to wear briefly. The wave left the hair as soon as it came out of the package. Don't buy it!
Output:negative

Input:My sister is a huge Viktor & Rolf scent fan,  I purchased set for her as a Christmas gift. I priced the set at various places, including fine dept stores, and Groupon. The set was $2 less at Groupon, with a long shipping time.  But, as much as $50 more, at dept stores. The packaging and scent were EXACTLY the same as dept stores. Groupon also had exact same packaging.  At Viktor & Rolf, packaging, bows, etc, vary, depending on size, set, edition, etc. We would have returned if not right (as it was Prime). She knows her perfume, and loved it. I also have the eau de parfume (same sister bought for me from major dept store:). She too says this set, including bath gel and lotion is an exceptional deal. Now I want a set too!

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Love this! It is so easy to set up and does the job. There are many sizes that can hold larger brushes as well. I love that it can be broken down and store easily!! Great product!

Input:Awesome top coat have been using it for over a year but I do not like the new bottle. It is hard to store.
Output:positive
Input:The inner rings were all broken and the ends of the comb to do appear to have been filed down and look very jagged around the edges. I thought that this was supposed to be a hard rubber comb, but it looks and feels like the one I can purchase at a beauty supply store except for the added metal bar that is at the base of the prongs, this could lead to extreme heat damage on the hair because it is not reported what kind of metal the bar is and how hot it can get.<br />I am very disappointed and will be attempting to return this product.
Output:negative
Input:I‚Äôm not sure this is 100% human hair it had various strings in it (see pics) as well as some clear plastic ones. Before install there was a good amount of shedding by just running my fingers through the hair to fluffen it. Which brings me to my next point, the hair was really crunchy and hard when it first arrived which leads me to believe it may have been processed to the color and curl pattern its currently in (its a jet black color). There is some sort of film that can be felt on the hair and it makes your hands feel as though they‚Äôre covered in something and the hair has a beauty supply store smell to it. Wefts were thick and easy to sew through. I cut my wefts so I have lots of additional shedding. Now I havent done anything to this hair but throw some water on it some days and the while the curls have gotten flat, they havent fell nor had its lost its move and body. I wet it thoroughly and the curls returned to their original shape. I was going to try and color it but since I believe its been processed I dont want to take the chance and have It become nappy and unmanageable. I havent added any type of product to the hair because I dont want it to lose its body, luster and shine. I‚Äôve only had it installed for about a week so if it happens to turn into a crows nest within the next couple weeks (I ususally keep my sew ins for three to four weeks) I‚Äôll update my review. Any questions let me know!<br /><br />Update 12/3/18- DEFINITELY been processed. I used my mizano chelating and neutralizing shampoo to wash and water turned colored as if black dye was being washed out. Curls still come back to life when they fall or become flat. Maintains bounce regardless of how long I dont comb it. I dont ANY product in this hair, afraid it may ruin it.
Output:positive
Input:Where have the original and best small clips gone? Seems they've been replaced by these. I have medium fine hair that the original clips are perfect in. These- the prongs are too widely spaced to work, at least for me. I was able to pull them right out of my hair without opening them. I donated these to a thrift store and hope someone else will have better luck with them. If it's not broke don't try to ""fix"" it!!!
Output:negative
Input:Myy beauty supply store never has the color hair I want so I ordered this. The color is beautiful... exactly as pictured. I gave 4 stars because the packs are smaller than usual and I did have some tangling while  installing my box braids.
Output:positive
Input:I purchased this dryer late June 2020 because the other dryer I already have like this was unavailable for a few months, and we needed another dyer after growing our staff. The heating element has already gone out. We've been tolerant of an intermittent rattle in the fan when the cool air/warm air buttons are selected, BUT once the heating element went out, it's just large and in the way. You HAVE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURE to assist in the warranty issues and THERE IS NO CONTACT INFO FOR THE MANUFACTURE listed in the Amazon listing, their ""store page"", or in the assembly info sent with the dryer. Purchase at your own risk. I highly suggest investing in a higher quality machine from a store with a reputation.

Input:I‚Äôve always used the glue kind of lashes before but I never really could get the hang of it & they never stayed on long enough. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever tried the magnetic kind & I love love love them! Maybe it‚Äôs the brand because my daughter hated the kind I got her in a store years ago, she couldn‚Äôt get them to stay but I‚Äôm going to get her this kind so she can see how great they are! I literally wear mine for 2 days straight. That‚Äôs even sleeping in them! Now I can only do that with 2 coats of liner, especially at the corners, but that‚Äôs no big deal. 2 quick coats, 3 minutes for it to get nice & tacky & then the eyelashes! Bam 1,2, 3 done! The part that takes me forever is deciding which pair to wear because every pair is nice & bold & just beautiful! I don‚Äôt need extra liner or any mascara. Pretty much all I need to do is throw some shadow in my creases, dab on some lipstick & a touch of something for the cheeks & im ready to go for any event. I also can just dab on some lipgloss & go. Nothing else, no fuss. Taking of the lashes are easier than with the glue & the liner comes off with some oil on a Q-Tip (I don‚Äôt like oil on my face due to sensitive skin so i localize it with the Q-tip). I really haven‚Äôt found anything wrong with the lashes at all & I've wore 4 different pairs now over a 10 day period.

Input:All 5 nano misters came in individual boxes.  I took them all out and tested all of them.  I'm really surprised on the output of these misters.  I had one I bought at a store and these spray out 4 times the mist.  They work great!  ATM I just fill them with distilled water and use it to refresh ourselves when it's dry.  It really gives a nice cooling effect!
Output:positive
Input:This conditioner is just meh for me. I was excited because it is full of natural oils but there are no ingredients on the bottle, which is suspect. I have been using it for a few weeks with a marked decrease in the smoothness of my hair and increased frizziness. It works about as well as regular cheap store conditioner, but it definitely doesn't perform like high end conditioner, or even Pantene. I will probably finish up this bottle because I don't like to waste things, but I wouldn't buy this again and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. The good thing about it is that it smells nice and it comes in a very big pump dispenser. If I could be more confident in the ingredients I would feel more comfortable with this product in general.<br /><br />I got this conditioner for free in order to try it out and review it. This is obviously my honest opinion, I didn't care for it much.
Output:negative
Input:These washcloths are far superior to the puff balls since this can be used for cleaning my back. They last forever, until you get annoyed with the slight fraying on the sides, but at this price, who cares. They wash out easily and dry in no time.<br />I used to have to go to the Japanese store to buy them but am happy to get them online now.
Output:positive
Input:This hair is terrible! The way it arrived is how it looks in the picture until it was uncoiled. The hair is very thin and lifeless. It resembles the quality of synthetic hair that one would find in a discount bin at your local hair store. This hair was in and out of my head within the same day. This hair isn't even sufficient for a quick hair style that you only want to wear briefly. The wave left the hair as soon as it came out of the package. Don't buy it!

ƒ†These,ƒ†eyel,"Input:I never, ever leave reviews, but I am so incredibly impressed with these lashes that I just had to. I have very small eyes with puffy eyelids and round cheeks, so with most false eyelashes I've tried in the past, I could feel them hitting the area under my brows or on my cheeks. Or they were so long that they hit my glasses. These are so natural looking! The magnetic liner was very easy to apply, and if you make a boo-boo, very easy to correct. I used a wet q-tip to clean up the line before I applied the lashes. The tool they give you to grab the lashes was incredibly helpful in putting them on. You can lightly tug on the lashes, and they stay put. A harder tug will removed them. I ordered the shorter, more natural set of 3, and they look like what nature should have given me. Love, love, love!!
Output:positive
Input:No fragrance.  These had obviously been sitting for a long time in a warehouse somewhere.  Greasy.  I threw them away.
Output:negative
Input:Good lashes but not dramatic enough for me.  They are lightweight and stay on for at least a week almost two.  The length is good but the drama isnt there.  These are good for everyday use for me.  I would buy again.
Output:positive
Input:I didn't expect much for the price. These are just for cutting the boys hair at home and that's all they will be good for. Super cheap but hey you get what you pay for.

Input:I purchased these for my son with autism.  He has sensory issues (sounds, tastes, touching sensations) and doesn't enjoy having his teeth brushed.  Because the brush surrounds his teeth, I'm able to get the brushing done in much less time.  These work very well for him and his needs due to his sensitivity.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The handles are nice and sturdy, with a powered rubberized feeling.<br />- There are nodules on the handle to help with grip as well.<br />- Each brush comes with a plastic cap for storage/travel.<br />- For a child, the &#34;pocket&#34; between the teeth is perfect for a pea sized amount of toothpaste.<br />- 4 toothbrushes per pack so if you have one person, you have all that you need for a year if you change every 3 months as recommended.<br /><br />This is the second time I've purchased this product.  I'd purchased brand previously, and the handles were much less substantial, and those didn't come with a cap to cover the brush.  So this brand is a much better value for me.  I did not receive a discount for this review, these are my personal unbiased opinions.
Output:positive
Input:I bought the lashes because I had extensions put on that ruined my natural eyelashes.  These are so easy and so natural.  I disaster became a plus because each lash looks perfect.  I'm so grateful for this purchase.
Output:positive
Input:I'm a man who wanted an easy to put on, stretch fabric bandana.  These are awesome, and I found that you can even remove the tie in the back so that they're just a headband with paisley print.  Looks awesome and comfortable to wear.
Output:positive
Input:The Hummingbird product is, basically, a cell phone vibration mechanism with a plastic toothpick attached.  These replacement attachments do not hold any value for a person that has a serious investment in their teeth.  A regular toothpick provides more rigid action while being less cumbersome.<br /><br />I promise you that the free toothpicks at any place you eat will beat this gimmicky Hummingbird product, hands down.
Output:negative
Input:Do not waste ur money. These puffs look nothing like the girl in the picture. The hair on these puffs look so fake and synthetic. Do not waste ur time or money. I sent this back and received a refund.
Output:negative
Input:I cannot say enough about this product.  These are gorgeous lashes.  They seem to be a very good quality of lash.  They are super soft and easy to mold to the eyelid.
Output:positive
Input:I hated these. These gloves are super cheap quality and don't fit well on your fingers. They're too long and ended up touching my pinky finger, so it would render them useless during a manicure. Also, they were both uneven (see super cheap quality above). Don't buy these! If you're going to get your nails gel manicured, you can also wear sunscreen on the tops of your hands. I can't tell you if it will be as effective, but that is what I will be doing since these are so poorly made.
Output:negative
Input:Received earlier than estimate. These are a bit large in comparison to many other cuff earrings I've had, and resist regular bending, but they work just as well. The ones I received have little holes in them, which is great because I was hoping to modify them with some feathers. This would have been given 5 stars, but I knocked one off because one of the cuffs was pretty badly bent, like something smashed into it. I did manage to fix it though.
Output:positive
Input:When they work, they're extremely convenient. These fit easily in a pocket or purse and hold enough perfume or cologne for extended trips. Unfortunately these don't last very long. I bought 4 for a two-week trip. By the end of the trip, two had stopped spraying and leaked every time I tried to use them. Maybe they're damaged by air travel, or maybe certain scents block the nozzle, I don't know. Nonetheless, a 50% failure rate after so little use coupled with the loss of cologne that's now trapped inside these two dispensers leaves me very displeased with this product.
Output:negative
Input:My skin is very dry and sensitive because the cold and dry climate, so redness and flakiness is always an issue with my skin. These night facial masks are amazing, I wake up with my skin looking dewy and moisturized.

Input:I have had clip in hair extensions before as I have very super thin hair. The last ones I had were very heavy and kind of scratchy feeling. They looked good and the price was right but they didn't feel natural. I was told to get Remy extension and it will make a world of difference. I have to tell you there is much truth to that statement. I ran across these and they said Remy(means made from real hair) so I thought I would give them a try. They are fabulous so light weight and smooth. They feel so soft and silky just like my hair but they curl better then my hair. I went with the golden brown cause it looked a lot like my color ( dirty blonde) they are perfect for me cause they are just a little off. Slightly lighter so it looks like I have highlights. I would not call them brown but they are quite true to color of the picture shown. If you have never done clips I just recommend you make sure they are taunt to you head when you clip them in, keeps them natural looking that way. If you are slightly off it will look bulky and not true. It takes practice but if I can do it with my super thin hair then almost anyone should be able to. Gray to make hair thicker or just add a little highlight. Being Remy they can be dyed as well. So glad I bought these

Input:This is my second time ordering this product. My friend bought me two of your silk scrunches and my hair was happy. I moved 4 times last year and was upset that I lost one of the scrunches during a move. The one I wore, lost its elasticity with me wearing it all night and most days for 2 years. So, after settling last year in my new home, I bought 2 more. I really like that they don‚Äôt dry my hair. Also, I appreciate that my hairs don‚Äôt get stuck in fabric and get pulled out from my scalp easily. These are worth the price.

Input:I will start by saying...i bought my very first bottle at ulta and the color aurora IS ABSOLUTELY  SPECTACULAR. It has the most gorgeous shimmer ever and i fell in love with this product!  When I bought my 2nd bottle from ulta and a 3rd bottle from cover fx directly, the droppers were defective and I was unable to get any product out. SO... that being said, I don't think the defective dropper is the seller's fault (on amazon). When i saw the awesome price on amazon, I immediately bought 2 bottles...both droppers were defective, so I got 2 replacements. The replacements had droppers that did not work as well. I am so disappointed and heartbroken because I LOVE the glitter drops, and the price was too good to be true. After 4 defective bottles from amazon...I give up on trying to find a bottle with a dropper that actually works.

Input:Okay so I literally NEVER write reviews but I seriously seeked out the product so I could write a review on it. Firstly, let me say OH MY GOD ITS AMAZING!!! I had some super bad break outs and my best friend being the doll she is bought me this face mask for Christmas. Initially I was obsessed with the packaging. SO cute. The. After a few weeks I decided to use it to see if it would help my face clear up before I started my job. It feels amazing on my skin, my bestie also got me these cool little wands to put on the face mask so that makes it a lot easier. They are Silacone so it just glides on your face. I put down a towel the first night on my pillow thinking it would stay wet all night but it dries fairly quickly! Woke up and honestly could already see a huge difference in clearness, lack of redness, my zits had shrunk and my face was SO soft. I have been using it the past week and it‚Äôs started ERASING my acne scars that I always obsess over because I hate them. I‚Äôm so excited about this product I‚Äôve been telling everyone about it. It works wonders for me. I know some people say it‚Äôs harsh on sensitive skin but I haven‚Äôt gotten that at all. It‚Äôs done wonders for my ehh skin to make it FABULOUS. Again, I love love love it. It‚Äôs now part of my normal night regimen for my skin!

This is real important. I had been ordering longer  if similar price so I could cut off ratty ends.. but that means that‚Äôs money/weight but if I went shorter in length they would drop weight so 14 inch wld be 40g. These are amazing. I got 14 inch 50g and they are full all the way to end. I wore as pony tail for a day. No knots none. I next hooked to a hat - yep like Joe dirt ü§£but I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. Again no rats. So impressed I put half in with my Bellami extensions. They have me so impressed I ordered 2 more different shades. Suppose to be here today.

Input:On the whole, my experience with this razor has been positive. Although I switched from manual razors mainly because I was tired of nicking myself and expected a trade-off in closeness, my girlfriend says that my skin is actually softer now that I used the 8140XL. Definitely give it a week or two after switching from a manual razor to let your skin adjust; my shaves got remarkably better after the first few days of use.<br /><br />- Pros: Leaves skin softer; shaves upper lip better than any manual razor; hair length after shave is consistent (including on neck); easy and quick to clean.<br />- Cons: Inevitably misses hairs (although it's hard to tell without close inspection); not quite as close as a manual razor, so you will have to shave every morning if you want a clean-cut look; sideburn cutter not especially useful.<br /><br />I recommend buying Lectric Shave or a similar product to prep your stubble for shaving with the 8140XL, it makes a small but significant difference in the closeness of the shave.

I relied heavily on other comments as I am inexperienced in the use of highlighter, and I am so happy that I went with this one! In addition to being priced very reasonably, I found that I really like the way it makes my face look.  I used it to highlight my brow bone, nose, and area above my cheek bones.  This highlighter is very pigmented, so a little goes a long way! It is very light and slightly shimmery but don't let that discourage you from getting it.  My skin is medium with yellow undertones, and I found that applying just a little really highlighted those areas without it looking too conspicuous or excessive.  Additionally, when I got home from work (9 hours after initial application) the highlighter had not faded! I am very satisfied with this product and I highly recommend it.  The product is shimmery but not excessively so.  All of my makeup, is matte, so this added just the right amount of shine!

Input:I picked one of the most expensive polygel I could find because I bought a cheap generic one and it worked awesome. So I figured if the cheap one was so awesome, the expensive one most be amazing! Nope. This is NOT polygel!! This is builder gel at best, only in a tube to make it appear to be polygel. On top of that!! It's not even a good builder gel! It feels almost like rubber after its cured and after wasting 3 hours trying to apply a full set as if it was polygel, I finally just used sticker nail forms and sculpted my nails. Only went through with it because I had already prepped my nails and had to go to work so there was no turning back. However, I didn't even make it through a whole hour during my shift before my Nails started popping off! I didn't even feel them come off! That's how weak this gel is. Please don't waste your time or money. I would give zero stars if I could.

Input:This item was for a set of 2 bottles and I only received 1 bottle. Very frustrating at Christmas time when you‚Äôre buying gifts and something like this happens.
Output:negative
Input:One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
Output:positive
Input:I was really impressed with these nail forms. I bought them to use with poly gel, which they work well with. I can now easily do my nails in a lot less time. The forms come off easy and the sizing works much better then other brands. Especially nice was that I can use them also with my regular favorite builder gel! That was a surprise, but I figured try it out. Even with my regular builder gel, these dorms are easy to work with and pop right off after curing the gel. It helps that there is a scale to use these forms very efficient.<br />I can only highly recommend this product.  This will be my go to product from now on!

Input:I'm glad to have my masks as I need them.<br />Good Value.<br />I had plenty of masks long before this purchase.<br />When my supply began dwindle, it was time to re-stock.<br />I wear two masks. Not for the virus but I wear them against...<br />1) smokers,  2) pollen , 3) people who douse themselves in perfumes & colognes.

Input:This eyeliner barely had any liquid in it. When I tried it on for the first time it barely applied because it was almost completely dried out already. It was a bummer to receive a dried one because I had heard good things about this eyeliner.
Output:negative
Input:Horrible quality. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I will spend a little more for something that will hold up. They fell apart after a single use.
Output:negative
Input:Bad quality. It is seperated with liquid and solid when I opend it. I ‚Äòve got replacement and it‚Äôs the same again. So disopointed and waisting time.

Input:When these scissors arrived, I was surprised because they looked like blunt kid scissors that I used to buy for my children in primary school.  I thought about returning these scissors, but decided to try them out and give them a chance.  I wasn't expecting much judging them from their appearance.<br />I purchased them to trim my dogs' fur, and the first time I groomed my dogs, I ended up being amazed!  The scissors were great!  They were sharp and they cut the dogs' fur perfectly!  With the rounded tips, it was safer for my dogs and I didn't have to cut as carefully as I used to cut using pointed-tip scissors.  So trimming went faster, and it was easier to trim the usually difficult paw fur.<br />I am happy and I would definitely recommend these scissors
Output:positive

Input:I got this set for my daughter's 3b hair. She was able to detangle her hair in 5 minutes, a project that usually take her an hour or more. Since she does her detangling in the shower, this brush probably paid for itself in water saved the first time she used it. After using the detangler, her hair looked healthier and shinier than it ever has before. I am a happy customer! She liked the comb too, but that detangler was a live changer.
Output:positive
Input:This is the only mineral makeup that doesn't irritate my skin.  Every other brand I've tried causes breakouts and dries out my skin.  I've used several brands over the years ranging from the drug store brands to the ridiculously expensive.  I also love that they disclose all their ingredients, makes me wonder what's in the competitors brands....<br /><br />The coverage is awesome, I probably use about a 1/3 of what I'd use with the other brands for the same coverage.  On hot/humid days I'm not rushing to wash it off like I do with the others because it still feels light.  It lasts me a long time and I will continue to buy it!

On top of that!! It's not even a good builder gel! It feels almost like rubber after its cured and after wasting 3 hours trying to apply a full set as if it was polygel, I finally just used sticker nail forms and sculpted my nails. Only went through with it because I had already prepped my nails and had to go to work so there was no turning back. However, I didn't even make it through a whole hour during my shift before my Nails started popping off! I didn't even feel them come off! That's how weak this gel is. Please don't waste your time or money. I would give zero stars if I could.

Input:This item was for a set of 2 bottles and I only received 1 bottle. Very frustrating at Christmas time when you‚Äôre buying gifts and something like this happens.

Input:One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.

Input:I was really impressed with these nail forms. I bought them to use with poly gel, which they work well with. I can now easily do my nails in a lot less time. The forms come off easy and the sizing works much better then other brands. Especially nice was that I can use them also with my regular favorite builder gel! That was a surprise, but I figured try it out. Even with my regular builder gel, these dorms are easy to work with and pop right off after curing the gel. It helps that there is a scale to use these forms very efficient.<br />I can only highly recommend this product.  This will be my go to product from now on!

Input:I'm glad to have my masks as I need them.<br />Good Value.<br />I had plenty of masks long before this purchase.<br />When my supply began dwindle, it was time to re-stock.<br />I wear two masks. Not for the virus but I wear them against...<br />1) smokers,  2) pollen, 3) people who douse themselves in perfumes & colognes.

Input:This eyeliner barely had any liquid in it. When I tried it on for the first time it barely applied because it was almost completely dried out already. It was a bummer to receive a dried one because I had heard good things about this eyeliner.
Output:negative
Input:Horrible quality. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I will spend a little more for something that will hold up. They fell apart after a single use.
Output:negative
Input:Bad quality. It is seperated with liquid and solid when I opend it. I ‚Äòve got replacement and it‚Äôs the same again. So disopointed and waisting time.
Output:negative
Input:this came on time very pretty stylish my sister loved her birthday present exactly how it looks its what you get.

Input:When these scissors arrived, I was surprised because they looked like blunt kid scissors that I used to buy for my children in primary school.  I thought about returning these scissors, but decided to try them out and give them a chance.  I wasn't expecting much judging them from their appearance.<br />I purchased them to trim my dogs' fur, and the first time I groomed my dogs, I ended up being amazed!  The scissors were great!  They were sharp and they cut the dogs' fur perfectly!  With the rounded tips, it was safer for my dogs and I didn't have to cut as carefully as I used to cut using pointed-tip scissors.  So trimming went faster, and it was easier to trim the usually difficult paw fur.<br />I am happy and I would definitely recommend these scissors
Output:positive
Input:Does not work. Don‚Äôt waste your money. You can not return this product. Don‚Äôt buy. Company had a business card inside package. Says ‚Äúdo not return, text message if dissatisfied. Will be reimbursed, if not satisfied‚Äù never heard back from the company. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money.
Output:negative
Input:I got this set for my daughter's 3b hair. She was able to detangle her hair in 5 minutes, a project that usually take her an hour or more. Since she does her detangling in the shower, this brush probably paid for itself in water saved the first time she used it. After using the detangler, her hair looked healthier and shinier than it ever has before. I am a happy customer! She liked the comb too, but that detangler was a live changer.
Output:positive
Input:This is the only mineral makeup that doesn't irritate my skin.  Every other brand I've tried causes breakouts and dries out my skin.  I've used several brands over the years ranging from the drug store brands to the ridiculously expensive.  I also love that they disclose all their ingredients, makes me wonder what's in the competitors brands....<br /><br />The coverage is awesome, I probably use about a 1/3 of what I'd use with the other brands for the same coverage.  On hot/humid days I'm not rushing to wash it off like I do with the others because it still feels light.  It lasts me a long time and I will continue to buy it!

Input:I bought this brush for 2 reasons. 1 to keep with me to brush beard throughout the day and to be able to put beard balm on without using my hands, this product fails at both. The main problem with this brush is how ridiculously soft the bristles are. I've had 3 or 4 different boars hair brushes (non designer or expensive) since I grew a manly beard couple years ago and they've all been alittle different stiffness but none have been anywhere near this soft and useless on a beard especially if it has more then 4 weeks of growth. It literally feels like a slightly stiff womens mascara brush. You cannot tame any beard of real length with this dolls toy and as far as using it to apply beard balm it does fit just barely inside the tin of balm but since its so soft you can &#34;paint&#34; on some balm just fine, then you have to take out your real boars brush to actually run the balm through your beard hairs. Not at all meant for beard hair, my daughters barbie just got a new brush. Oh and to tall in the tin to be a good travel brush. Back to the lil wood 1 my hair clippers came w for the car.
Output:negative
Input:I absolutely love the Pudaier mascara.  This was my first time trying this one and I am hooked.  I bought 4 tubes just to be safe!!!
Output:positive
Input:This mascara is horrible to apply. It really clumps on. I think there is too much space between the bristles. It took a lot of work to fix the mess it caused. Once I picked with a toothpick and straightened out my lashes they look really good and the mascara did not smudge, which is why I gave it 2 stars. Also it was not easy to remove like the manufactures claimed. The price is very reasonable but not worth it.
Output:negative
Input:The very best mascara that I have ever used!! Love it!
Output:positive
Input:The bristles on the mascara wand were too long for my liking. As for the mascara itself, it‚Äôs very thin, almost kind of runny, and I found it didn‚Äôt do much for my lashes. It didn‚Äôt seem to cling to my lashes. I kept applying more coats, but still didn‚Äôt see great results. This one isn‚Äôt for me.
Output:negative
Input:Excellent product for the best price. I have paid double or even triple for the kind of coverage this mascara has. Love it!!
Output:positive
Input:I had to throw this away and count it as money lost. The mascara was old and cakey, and Bare Escentuals wouldn't replace it since this isn't an authorized seller. Buyer beware!
Output:negative
Input:Hate it! Burns my eyes. Goes on super clumpy. The wands are so thin that the mascara can‚Äôt hang on smoothly. Threw all of them away.
Output:negative
Input:This product looks like it would be a great tool, but for me I was not at all impressed. The mascara ends up on the tool instead of your lashes for the most part. The application process was not at all what I had expected from this product based on the description. For a teen just learning how to apply makeup it might be a useful tool, but I wasn't impressed with it as a tool for those who like a heavy mascara.
Output:negative
Input:I may update later today but I‚Äôm very happy with this mascara. No harmful products and goes on nice. Separates lashes nicely. Had to use 2 coats but that‚Äôs reasonable. It is not brown, not at all but black. I can go either way but if someone needs brown, it‚Äôs not. Tiny bit of splatter above lash line but I was in a hurry and not noticeable except in magnifying mirror. I could do better. As far as all day wear I will update. Sure there are more volumizing thickening brands but not worth it in health points. It looks natural. For fuller longer I will go in for lash extensions. I have very sensitive eyes. No problem so far.
Output:positive
Input:The mascara was completely dry making this product unable to be used. Complete waste of money
Output:negative
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I really like this mascara.  It doesn't clump or flake and really makes your lashes pop.  My only negative is that it dries slowly.
Output:positive
Input:I ordered this due to Bethany Frankel‚Äôs TikTok Decent enough product but it‚Äôs a small bottle very thick mascara and a little clumpy for $20
Output:negative
Input:The eyeliner was dried out and would pull on my eye. The blue mascara wand was broken off so I couldn‚Äôt even use it.
Output:negative
Input:I was trying to find something like this for a long time.Great design.I use the comb to de-clumpify my lashes and it separates them very well.I didn t really need mascara brush but 2 in 1 is even better. Love the product because I can hide the comb and that helps to keep my cosmetic bag clean. Thank you for making it

ƒ†thick,ƒ†falling,"Input:My oldest daughter has very thick hair and loves the brush. It really works on those knots.
Output:positive
Input:I bought this because someone on social media said it was better than Shine and Jam. I read the reviews and people seemed to rave over it. But I was not impressed. I‚Äôve noticed a thick,white coating on the hair and it doesn‚Äôt appear to moisturize at all. I‚Äôm going back to the basics. I‚Äôll be rocking with my shine and jam from here on out.
Output:negative
Input:So.. I wanted thick eye brows and eyelashes. I refuse to draw on my eye brows or wear fake lashes. I am 35 and I am too old for that lol. Took about 3 months of consistently putting this on my lashes and brows every night to see a difference. (You can use it as make up remover too) I have been doing it for almost a year now. No need to pencil in anything and my eyelashes are thick and long and awesome. Way better to fix the problem than to keep covering it up! Highly recommend!
Output:positive
Input:I have thick hair so it takes a while to get through it all. But it works OK and I like it. Thank you.
Output:positive
Input:The sizes aren't consistent with other nail brands. These are hard thick plastic, shorter than the picture, and each size is either too big or too small for my fingernails.<br />Also, who has square cuticles???
Output:negative
Input:Please don‚Äôt mind my eyebrows. The girls just healing from being micro bladed.<br />- I purchased 19 MM 2<br />- LOVE THE LASHES!<br />- I attached a photo with wispies on top, and the lashes I bought (19MM 2) on the bottom.<br />As you can see a huge difference on my eyes. I am an Asian woman... southeast Asian. Somewhat bigger eye shape above average.<br />- The band is not thick. It‚Äôs not thin either. It‚Äôs a perfect width where it blends in nicely and is very lightweight.<br />- I love the length and fullness of the lashes. If I am going for the ABG look, these are the lashes!<br />- Price is great for the quality. The packing is adorable, and you get 10 pairs for $9!! Can‚Äôt beat this deal!
Output:positive
Input:Great for the price! I'm obsessed with this, it curls my hair in about fifteen minutes, and when you have waist length thick hair, you know that's a miracle. My only complaint is that when you do smaller ringlets, they fall out after about two or three hours and you're stuck with waves. I didn't use the glove at all, and I found it very easy to use.
Output:positive
Input:We have very thick hair and this does work for us. I went with a cheaper one to try for starters and I regret it
Output:negative
Input:I liked the hair right out the package. The length was as described and the texture is of a relaxed or straighten African American texture. However, it didn‚Äôt take long before I noticed the negatives. First, although, the hair looks thick it‚Äôs widely spaced at the scalp. The hair did shed slightly. Second the hair was really difficult to saturate with water. I tried washing the hair but it took about 5 or 6 minutes for the hair to feel wet. (This made me think that this is not 100% human hair throughout 100% of the Mannequin head. It may be a human hair blend.)Then I noticed that the quarter size amount of shampoo would not rinse completely out of the hair. I tried rinsing I for another 8 or 9 minutes. There were slight suds that would not rinse out. Finally, as I was blow drying the hair I noticed several areas in the top and sizes of the scalp area that had white dots at the hair roots. I‚Äôm pretty sure they were lice nits. After reasearching I learned that this could happen if hair isn‚Äôt properly deloused. That‚Äôs when I decided to return the mannequin. The return process was simple with no issues. I also got a chance to curl a section with my curlers set on 400 degrees. The hair curled nicely but the curls combed right out afterwards. Please inspect any mannequin you get. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt buy it but keep the box just in case.
Output:negative
Input:Got it on a flash sale love that I payed less then $2 like it but not made for really thick hair
Output:positive
Input:Horrible quality!! Stems super thick, lashes bend and are very flimsy. Lashes rip easily. DO NOT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
Output:negative
Input:Im a chef and these come in handy instead of wearing a hair net but I have thick hair and bc of that they over stretched. Definitely need hair pins to hold in place. But overall I like them
Output:positive
Input:I have long, thick, dark hair. This brush works great!! Doesn't pull as much hair as all the other round brushes I've used in my life. And it really does seem to prolong the need to wash my hair. It makes a big difference in the amount of fly-aways and frizz too.
Output:positive
Input:Terrible color. To thick. Not what I was expecting.
Output:negative
Input:I've been using Conair dryers for quite a few years, and have liked the Conair Nano Silver. However, I always like to keep a new one on hand for the day the old one conks out on me. So I went shopping. The Nano Silver I have now -- my second one -- has pretty good power and heat, though not as high as I'd like, since I have fairly thick hair.  But that model was no longer available. So I tried and returned one of the Conair Reel models (one of the cheaper ones) as well as the Conair Infiniti Pro.  Neither could dry my hair fast enough to set a style. So I spent a little more this time and bought the Jilbere, and so far I'm delighted. I have quite a few stubborn cowlicks and waves in my fairly thick hair that usually won't go away when I try to blow-dry it into a straight bob. But the Jilbere, with its 2000 watts, first time out gave me the smooth straight hair I wanted -- almost a &#34;salon sleek look. Now, the old Nano Silver is in the closet as a backup, because I like the Jilbere so much I can't go back. One more much-touted dryer brand I've tried is the Chi. Granted, it was one of its more moderately priced models, though higher than Conair, but it performed about like a $20 dryer.

Input:I got this from my stylist in Austin and have LOVED it for 3 months now.  I don't use it often- maybe every other week, but it still works great for me.  It has a fragrance that I really like, but it is unique- kinda powdery-but pleasant.  The best advice my salon gave me was to shake it shake it shake it and when you think you shook it enough, shake it again.  I just bought a drugstore brand su*** to try to tighten my purse strings, and there is absolutely no comparison.  I think the kevin murphy is worth the money!  to help you compare:  I have fine hair but a lot of it, highlighted and past shoulder length.  I tend to get oily at the roots slightly on day 2 after a shampoo and very oily if I wait 3 days- product works great with both of my levels of oily-ness.
Output:positive
Input:I have long thin hair and I've tried so many detanglers, but this one is the absolute best. I like that there is no residue, minimal scent, and the spray is a nice mist. I've also have noticed less hair fallout when brushing through my hair. For the price this is such a great value!

Input:The lace closure is NOT medium/middle brown. It has a greenish tint to it and looks like it doesn‚Äôt blend well with my skin. Sadly, I waited too late to order something different so I‚Äôll give an update once it is installed. The hair has a smell on it, but that probably will wash out. The hair doesn‚Äôt tangle and is easy to comb through, but I‚Äôll confirm once installed.

Input:This brush really does work..I was surprised, I have curly hair and when i comb my hair it hurts. This brush seems like a flimsy little plastic brush, but pleasantly surprised me when it combed through my curly tangles. I gave a 4 star because i think they could be made a little better. But they are definately worthing giving a try.
Output:positive
Input:I don't understand the bad reviews. If melatonin pills don't work for you then maybe it's just your brain chemistry, but this works better for me than any sleeping bill or melatonin pill and with the added benefit of relaxing my muscles in a similar way that an Epsom salt bath would. I'm not sure it makes me fall asleep necessarily, but I notice that my sleep is definitely deeper and I wake up feeling way more well rested and as if my sleep was richer and more effective. I really love it and keep a supply on hand always. It's great for airplane rides and right after you shower before bed.<br />I read one review here that someone said it was sticky and stayed on their skin, but then followed up with how they were on a vacation on an island and couldn't shower for 2 days. Haha, way to blame this great product for your bad travel choices. The lotion is not sticky and I really only just put a little on my index finger tip and thumb tip and give myself a neck massage with it to rub it in and on any other sore spots. That coupled with my firm mattress and I sleep so well.<br />Drink plenty of water througout the day, and don't drink any alcohol or beverages before bed and maybe try a warm soothing shower or bath before bed. Rub some of this lotion on the back of your neck and shoulders and in the soft skin spots like your elbow and knee pits so it will soak in well. You will have wonderful dreams and wake up feeling as if your REM sleep went deeper and longer than before. Don't look at electronics before bed and make sure you are sleeping in a cool dark room and are clearing your mind of worrying thoughts. It's really a great tool in your sleep tool box.<br />Remember that sleeping pills, especially crazy ones like ambien ... and alcohol too, are so bad for your sleep and sleep is the most important thing you can do for yourself. I love the fact that I really can go without coffee in the morning when I have a great long sleep. And my appetite totally changes and I crave health foods instead of unhealthy ones.

Input:I am obsessed with this nail polishes!!!! The color lays awesome. Not only the nail polish itself is a good formula but the brush is perfect as well. Bristles are soft and they spread out wide with just a little bit of effort, covering sometimes the whole surface of the nail! I like these even with a single layer of it! Dries super fast! I was able to do it while running after my toddler! The photo color is Lilac. Lasts a week because then I can see my nail growing at the base and I am picky about that. But since it is inexpensive, much cheaper than salon, and much much quicker, I can just change it every week!
Output:positive
Input:I really wanted this product to be amazing but it wasn't.  I ended up letting my kids have it for play make up because it's not worth the time it takes to put it on. The strain isn't bright or dark enough and it don't last long at all.  Literally my lips go back to normal after like 15 minutes.  I won't buy this again
Output:negative
Input:Hair didn‚Äôt last a week. I only ordered because my original vendor was out of stock of my hair so I needed something to ship and deliver quick. Hair didn‚Äôt hold a curl and begin to get brittle days later. It feels like baby doll hair mixed with human strands. Won‚Äôt purchase any bundles off Amazon ever again because most of these companies hair is mixed with synthetic fibers.
Output:negative
Input:I have used this and like it very much! Makes a nice lather and rinsed well. So glad to see I can get it on Amazon now!

ƒ†into,ƒ†wonderful,"Input:Love these folding travel toothbrushes!!! They are so much better than all of the old school toothbrush cover options. The bristles fold down into the handle, so you never have to worry about wet bristles or the cover popping off. Good quality, good solution! The bristles aren‚Äôt super hard either, which is nice. My family and I will be using these every time we travel.
Output:positive
Input:I LOVE THIS! I recently moved and no longer have a large vanity top. My straightener kept falling into the sink and was driving me crazy. This has great suction and is so easy to use. LOVE IT.
Output:positive
Input:All the directions state about the trays is: &#34; Place thermal tray in hot water (200 degrees) and get your teeth impressioned.&#34; Nothing about how long to put it in the water to allow it to mold to your teeth. I held the tray in the almost 200 degree water and it basically melted in less than 10 seconds. I had know idea how I was supposed to go about doing this and because the directions were unclear, I was unable to use this product. The trays cannot be fixed once they have basically shriveled up into nothing. For kicks, I did the second tray and held it in the water for about 3 seconds. So for those of you interested in buying this product, do not place the trays in water for more than 5 seconds.
Output:negative
Input:The baggies came very quickly, which was great, but I‚Äôm not sure they are actually anything special for using for soap. They are just thin nylon with a ribbon on top to pull shut. That‚Äôs fine though since they are so cheap. My biggest concern is that they came tied up in a little grocery bag which was then put into a regular clear bag for products. Lots of plastic and a bit questionable‚Ä¶
Output:negative
Input:I was excited for these, because my brushes always leave sparkles and color all over my make up bags. But these did not work well!! They are so so small and couldn‚Äôt even make it up the stick of my brush. It kept getting stuck and was too small. I ended up breaking off the brush part from the stick because of the force I was trying to use to move the silicon up. The small eyeshadow ones were way too small to get the hairs in. It‚Äôs almost impossible to get all the hairs into the covering, and not get them sticking to the outside. Also not sure why they have suction cups on the back side of them. Overall it‚Äôs a pain to even attempt to put the silicon on the stick and then over the hairs. Not worth it and doesn‚Äôt work well. Will probably do more damage to you brush in trying to put it on, than good that‚Äôd come from it
Output:negative
Input:First impression is that the smell is mainly eucalyptus based, but not too strong. The texture out of the can is at first very creamy, which I thought may affect the holding power, but once I worked in a couple of fingertip sized scoops into my hair, I found that the pomade started to take hold and firm up. My hair held its shape throughout the day and was easy to fix with a comb if needed. When washing it out, despite containing oils and wax, regular shampoo seemed to do the trick. Little to no residue leftover in my hair after a shower.
Output:positive
Input:overpriced, only 1 oz. has a low melting temperature, so if your feet are warm, it melts on and the product is very oily, so you have to wear socks or risk getting oil on clothes, furniture carpet etc. The socks soak up the oil so I don't know how much of product is getting absorbed into my heels.  I've tried Earth to Skin Care for heel renewal, which is what I thought I was buying and I prefer that brand since it's not as oily.  It's also priced more reasonably.
Output:negative
Input:I use this serum, along with other products for my face day and night. I have adult acne, that used to cause self-esteem issues. However, after incorporating this serum and benzoyl peroxide cream into my day/night regimen, I now have an occasional break-out during the beginning of my menstrual cycle. Even then, my skin will clear on its own within a couple days of my cycle ending. My search for the best skin treatments began when I was determined to do all I could, before I resorted to my medical treatments or pills that can further damage my skin or any other part of my body. I'm already in the process of ordering another two bottles!
Output:positive
Input:This is a nice and handy little carry case for travel.  It will hang from a hook or drawer draw so all of your cosmetics or personal care/hygiene products will be handy.  No need to spread everything over the counter top to annoy your travel buddy.  There are lots of cubbies both mesh and standard along with several zipper compartments.  Everything is collapsed up into an 8x13 case that will fit in a carry on.  And needless to say it's easy to get through TSA.

Input:This hair does not stay straight for anything! After being at the salon for an install and a cut the hair waved up on the ride home, UGH! And it‚Äôs advertised that it will arrive straight but it did not so the stylist straightened it before cutting it into the style, which was a waste of time and money since this hair won‚Äôt stay straight! It sheds a lot and tangles horribly! I deserve the money back for my hair and the install! What a waste!!!
Output:negative
Input:I originally got this toothbrush from my dentist.  This toothbrush gets into tight areas around the base of my teeth and my back teeth. I am currently doing Invisilign so its important I keep my teeth really clean. When I see my dentist she always remarks how clean I keep my teeth.  Highly recommend this brush.
Output:positive
Input:This is a poor quality item, very cheaply made and the tweezer tips have no way to activate the tweezing action without putting your fingers very close to the tip, which blocks your vision into the ear to begin with. It does light up nicely but that's about it. I guess I was just disappointed because I really liked the tweezing idea.
Output:negative
Input:My scalp usually goes into full flakey meltdown with most shampoos.  This shampoo seems to be OK and my diva scalp isn't revolting.<br /><br />I'm a little weird but the shape of the bottle is unique and a great fit for my massive man mitts.  Feels like I'm picking up a jug of oil or something.<br /><br />Good product, for guys and gals.
Output:positive
Input:The length, profile and description of this clip indicate it is suited for long, thick hair.  It is not.  It can hold thin or average hair, but the design is such that the claws only open a very small width.  If you truly have thick hair you realize this will never work as there is no way to get the needed amount of hair into the clip itself without breaking it, especially if you are trying to put your hair up entirely.  The material is very lightweight And insubstantial as well, so there is just no way that it can accommodate even shoulder length thick hair in a half up style, let alone fully up.  To see or understand the difference, large octopus clips made by Style of Paris are exactly the the type of material and form that actually does hold thick wavy hair in numerous styles.  This clip was very unsatisfactory all around, especially for the price, and I returned it.
Output:negative
Input:This product is disappointing. I spent time and money making the product that went into them and almost all of containers leaked everything out before it could solidify. Don't waste your money.

Input:The length, profile and description of this clip indicate it is suited for long, thick hair.  It is not.  It can hold thin or average hair, but the design is such that the claws only open a very small width.  If you truly have thick hair you realize this will never work as there is no way to get the needed amount of hair into the clip itself without breaking it, especially if you are trying to put your hair up entirely.  The material is very lightweight And insubstantial as well, so there is just no way that it can accommodate even shoulder length thick hair in a half up style, let alone fully up.  To see or understand the difference, large octopus clips made by Style of Paris are exactly the the type of material and form that actually does hold thick wavy hair in numerous styles.  This clip was very unsatisfactory all around, especially for the price, and I returned it.
Output:negative
Input:This product is disappointing. I spent time and money making the product that went into them and almost all of containers leaked everything out before it could solidify. Don't waste your money.

ƒ†a,ƒ†well,"Input:This CONBOLA Make Up Organizer is pretty handy for organizing small makeup items. I ordered the white and grey, and it looks quite nice. I would say it looks just like the pictures.<br /><br />The grey is a sturdy and durable plastic. The white inserts are a nice, thick, and flexible silicone. It will separate into 7 different pieces which is convenient and also makes everything easy to clean. You can use it all together or individual pieces separately.<br /><br />The mirror is fine and you insert into place and remove by pulling back out. I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up. Most of my brushes don‚Äôt fit as well into the bigger sized slots, but it still works.<br /><br />This is cute overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it.<br /><br />Basically this is a cute open storage. Most off the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of closed storage. I think the company could make this design into and awesome display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice since you can‚Äôt pack everything inside it when it is time to go.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a nice little product if you think the size and function will suit your needs. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!

Input:This was delivered in a box that was too small for the item. So the antlers were broken off. They are too expensive. The item looks very cheap in person. Also, Claire‚Äôs did not give me my money back.
Output:negative
Input:The shaver works well and is very comfortable. It also looks good. There is a low battery indicator that lets the user know when the shaver needs to be charged.<br /><br />The head structure dosen't have any room to store a lot of clippings so must be cleaned after each use. It's easy to clean since you only need open the shave heads and rinse it under running water. I leave the heads open to dry and then close them when I am ready to use it again. It comes with a hard carrying case. If you need to wash the head and then immediately store it when wet, this may be a problem but since I don't travel a lot, it's not a problem
Output:positive
Input:Product did not look like in the picture. It is clear in the picture that it has a gold logo but the one we received looked cheap quality with no logos at all. I kept it because it is not worth the drive to return it. Do not be fooled by the pictures! It does not look anything like it!!!

Input:This product has a weird smell and is one of the worst conditioners I've used. I bought it because it was sulfate-free and as a daily-hair-washer, that's important. But there are many other sulfate-free options that are much better.
Output:negative
Input:I am very disappointed with this product. It said that it was 20 inches. That‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs more like 16 inches. Much shorter than I like. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. A total waste of money.

I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up. Most of my brushes don‚Äôt fit as well into the bigger sized slots, but it still works.<br /><br />This is cute overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it.<br /><br />Basically this is a cute open storage. Most off the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of closed storage. I think the company could make this design into and awesome display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice since you can‚Äôt pack everything inside it when it is time to go.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a nice little product if you think the size and function will suit your needs. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!

Input:This was delivered in a box that was too small for the item. So the antlers were broken off. They are too expensive. The item looks very cheap in person. Also, Claire‚Äôs did not give me my money back.
Output:negative
Input:The shaver works well and is very comfortable. It also looks good. There is a low battery indicator that lets the user know when the shaver needs to be charged.<br /><br />The head structure dosen't have any room to store a lot of clippings so must be cleaned after each use. It's easy to clean since you only need open the shave heads and rinse it under running water. I leave the heads open to dry and then close them when I am ready to use it again. It comes with a hard carrying case. If you need to wash the head and then immediately store it when wet, this may be a problem but since I don't travel a lot, it's not a problem
Output:positive
Input:Product did not look like in the picture. It is clear in the picture that it has a gold logo but the one we received looked cheap quality with no logos at all. I kept it because it is not worth the drive to return it. Do not be fooled by the pictures! It does not look anything like it!!!

Input:This product has a weird smell and is one of the worst conditioners I've used. I bought it because it was sulfate-free and as a daily-hair-washer, that's important. But there are many other sulfate-free options that are much better.
Output:negative
Input:I am very disappointed with this product. It said that it was 20 inches. That‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs more like 16 inches. Much shorter than I like. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. A total waste of money.

ƒ†keep,ƒ†less,"Input:Love these brushes! We own two because I have one curly headed child and one with very thin straight hair.  They both want to keep their hair long.  However, prior to our purchase, brushing was a nightmare of whining and suicidal thoughts (on my part).  I'm not sure how the brush works, but I do know that my daughter stopped fuzzing!  I can comb her long locks without tears, which makes me very happy!  And, as a bonus, their hair looks great!!!!

Input:My skin tends towards the dry side and I rely on a regimen of lotions and potions to keep me hydrated. This product,despite its smal size<br />(which goes a long way!) is a great addition to my daily routine.Put it on in the morning while your face is still wet and your delicate eye area<br />will remain hydrated throughout the day. I carry it in my travel bag for an on-the-go moisturizer!

Input:This Pretty Frank natural deodorant has a pretty strong Jasmine scent. The instructions say to use a piece size amount. I didn‚Äôt read that at first and applied too much making the smell over powering. If you use the appropriate amount, the smell is not too strong. It helps keep you fresh smelling all day! Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor. I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising! If that does the trick, I will update my review to five stars. The weather in my area is very stormy, so I am unable to give this a full testing! However, this has worked for me so far wearing this under normal daily activities.
Output:positive
Input:Really like this bath powder container. Many different colors, patterns. Perfect size to keep on the counter/bath and great price. Giving a couple as gifts with the recipient's favorite fragrant powder.

Input:If you are looking for soft, flowing waves keep looking. If you strive for that I am homeless and do not own a hairbrush, than look no farther. Seriously, it's so bad. I wake up with better hair than this product gives me. Super bummed. The upside is it is made well so in 5 years when I forget how worthless this is, it will probably come out of the linen closet working like new.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this mascara at a Seattle beauty salon on the recommendation of their regional rep. I should have been suspicious when she said ""it never dries out"" by way of claiming the product does not flake during the day. The problem is, you'd have to go through the day without blinking to keep the stuff off the skin around your eyes -- even resorting to using it only on the upper lashes, I still looked like I had a couple of shiners after only a couple of hours
Output:negative
Input:These came in the mail today and I am as disappointed as all the other 1 star reviewers here. These are B-A-D bad! They are thin and the adhesive back does not stay. The only way to salvage these might be to use crazy glue to keep them in one place... which means they are worthless otherwise. Please think twice before purchasing these.
Output:negative
Input:I have used this product for about 3 years now, and recommend it fully. The only purpose for ""waterbed conditioner"" is to keep in check the organisms which naturally live and multiply in the water inside your waterbed. They create the bubbles you routinely have to purge from the bed -- if you don't regularly treat the water with a chemical which impedes those creatures' lives, they make many more bubbles and can eventually ruin the inside of your waterbed bag. You only need to use 4 ounces every 6 months, or 8 ounces once a year. I have slept on a waterbed for 40 of my 60 years, so I have enough experience in the matter.<br />You will know when it's time to purge the air from the bag and add conditioner, because the noise of the bubbles in the bag will begin to bother you and keep you awake. That's the time to purge the bubbles, and add 4 or 8 ounces of conditioner -- the size of the bed does not matter, just add a 4-ounce bottle every 6 months.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Love these brushes! We own two because I have one curly headed child and one with very thin straight hair.  They both want to keep their hair long.  However, prior to our purchase, brushing was a nightmare of whining and suicidal thoughts (on my part).  I'm not sure how the brush works, but I do know that my daughter stopped fuzzing!  I can comb her long locks without tears, which makes me very happy!  And, as a bonus, their hair looks great!!!!
Output:positive
Input:My skin tends towards the dry side and I rely on a regimen of lotions and potions to keep me hydrated. This product,despite its smal size<br />(which goes a long way!) is a great addition to my daily routine.Put it on in the morning while your face is still wet and your delicate eye area<br />will remain hydrated throughout the day. I carry it in my travel bag for an on-the-go moisturizer!

Input:I will say that the exterior of this is nice‚Ä¶<br /><br />HOWEVER, having said that I can say this does not fit my personal needs at all. The elastic loops are WAY too big for the most part, except one of the pages (?) can comfortably hold 5ml/10ml bottles well. The rest are made for 30ml bottles. The stiff clear plastic pouch is an awful feature and could have been better designed or maybe even some rows of small bottle loops (for 1/2/3ml ones).

Input:Lume what happened? First time trying your product with Twisted Lime. Hoping for a fun summery citrus. I thought my senses were playing tricks on me when I first smelled it so gave it a try. I could smell it on my body and worried someone would smell it on me and think I stank from it!!! It‚Äôs most unpleasant. My daughter said ‚Äúit smells like odor‚Äù. It‚Äôs a shame. Great product idea. Wanted to love it but it‚Äôs in the trash.

Input:This is another one of my favorite products I was given this to try and give my honest review on,  Red Rock Organics - BEST Eye Gel, Eye Cream... is truly amazing and it really does what it said it would do this is now one of the only products that I will continue to use every day the results are real and they last no gimmicks no hype to this products it does just what it states it will do I have been using now for about  2 weeks and I already see a bid change in my eyes.  The dark circles are all but gone the puffiness has also gone and the fine lines have faded I truly love this product and will use it from now on Thank you

Input:I ordered these thinking they would be average gauge, since I could not find anywhere on there that said the size. I was very disappointed. Normally I wear between an 18 and a 20g. I couldn't even wear them. They would not stay in because of how small they were. I gave it two stars because other than that the studs were exactly as expected. Vibrant colors and received on time.

Input:Miraculous stuff... I have arthritis in my joints of my hands so in the morning it's hard to get moving.  I heard this was the wd-40 for joints so I had to give it a shot.  Worked wonders- first morning after using cream the day before was much better.  The pain and stiffness was cut down by half!  And the morning after that- NO PAIN NO STIFFNESS!  Use twice a day and make sure to wash wherever you put it as it is a solvent and will dissolve anything already there and move it straight into your body.  That being said, you could combine it with a myriad of remedies like castor oil, food grade diluted hydrogen peroxide, etc.  awesome!!!

Input:Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She said they were very soft, blended her foundation perfectly with no hair fallout.  She used ll the brushes and they picked up eyeshadow without excess and reduced fallout.  The color blending was very smooth.
Output:positive
Input:I found a coupon for it online and figured why not. It wasn't something I have ever tried before and it seem interesting. I love lavender, it's very calming and best for meditating and while going to sleep. I never heard of a eye mask that heats up until now! I have heard that the Japanese used something similar to get rid of dark circles and keep their eyes bright and I love Asian beauty care. I got the purple one since the green ones didn't seem very good looking. It was too bright of a color for night-time.  I tried half the pack, I gave the other pack to my sister to try since she always has trouble sleeping.<br /><br />Fit - 4/5<br />It was hard to get used to the paper like feeling of the mask, it doesn't really block out sunlight very well, so use this if your room is very dark. It was a perfect fit for my eyes. You put one part of the mask on your ear to prevent it from falling off while you sleep.<br /><br />Does it Work? - 5/5<br />Yes! You have a play with it until you feel a heat, then put it on. It felt really nice, especially on a cold/cool night. The smell of lavender made me fall right asleep. The heat wasn't too hot, but just right. So you felt a relaxing heat, not a hot morning sun type of heat. Although, I don't recommend using this on a hot night, it feel like a desert.<br /><br />Overall - 5/5<br /><br />Do I recommend?<br />Yes I do! My sister said she will by more since it help with her sleep problem. She doesn't take sleeping pills and doesn't suffer from extreme insomnia. If you ever have trouble sleeping, give this a go! You have nothing to lose. It's cheap and you have plenty to give to your friends if it doesn't work out for you. This is perfect for your daughter's sleepover. Safe for most ages (probably around 7+ in age)

Input:I purchased this scarf in purple, as well as a set of Pro eyeshadow brushes, from ""Smart Dara"" and it took a little over 3 weeks for delivery, (but the package still arrived about 3 weeks before the earliest estimated delivery date) ,so Kudos to the seller for fast shipment from China in half the estimated delivery time.  All the items I purchased from this seller arrived in the same mailing envelope, which was great considering the $2.99 shipping charge I paid for the eyeshadow brushes alone,... but I was slightly upset that my delicate scarf was wadded up & stuffed into the mailing envelope in such a careless manner. It was in it's own plastic package seperate from the brushes (which were also individually packaged and survived transit wonderfully)..but my scarf was all rolled up in it's package like a peanut-butter roll in a wadded mess and so wrinkled that I had to hand-wash it to make it presentable as soon as I opened it. Now with all that said, the upside is......I found that these scarves stand up to hand-washing really well & don't lose any of the lovely sparkle embellishment that's in them when washed carefully with Woolite. They also don't get tangles in the dainty rosette fringes if you wash by gently squeezing the water/detergent thru the fabric and they dry really fast..in less than 1/2 hour over a hanger. The only con I've found to the scarf is that the delicate embroidered lace material it's made of...has about an inch of raw edges at both ends of the underside of the triangle where the fringed rosettes are sewn to the lace. The lace material is rough-cut all the way around where the fringe is attached and it's obvious that the lace was just cut from a bolt & then the fringe was sewn on to it with a ""Made in China"" tag sewn in...it's a very simple design. Not a major problem,though..I folded over the inch of raw fabric to about 1/8"" and back-stitched in a clean seam to make it look more finished where the raw edges were. All in all....for $3.19 these scarves are well worth it and are absolutely beautiful. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more if there was a bigger selection of colors...like peach,seafoam,fuchia,teal or even a darker green or brighter blue...but the purple is the only color I cared to order from the selection given.

Input:I hate to admit it but I had the same maybelline eyelash curler for the past 15 years. I really didnt use it much in those 15 years because everytime I used it it really didnt do much of anything that I could tell. So I would say. out of those 15 years I might have used it 50 times. But i also was never a big makeup user either. I probably only put makeup on a couple of times a week if I was going out. Fast forward to today and at 37 years old, and a mom of 2, I am wearing makeup alot now to hide the dark circles from no sleep and the beginning signs of age..sigh.., well anyway I tried that old eyelash curler for the last time and threw it out since i have seen so many you tube videos and it looks like their eyelashes curl when they use it. So I said to myself, lets try this again but also dont break th bank either in case it doesnt work again. So I ordered this one. It came super fast and is in a cute package and little bag. Holy eyelashes batman!!!!! I freaking love this thing!!!! It curls so easily! No pinching or having to try and get all the lashes in there. It is like it was made for me. I love it, buy this, dont make a 15 year long mistake like I did. Juat get this nd have happy lashes!!

Input:I really wanted to like this. I love Sandalwood as a scent, and used to get it in these little soapstone jars just like these at a health store and it was by far my favorite perfume. Unfortunately as soon as I opened it I was sorely disappointed. It smells like a typical deodorant, not at all like Sandalwood. It's quite strong. My boyfriend said it smells like ivory soap. Either way, it has a strong ""clean"" scent, not an earthy yet subtle and fresh scent of sandalwood. I did order the rose as well and am hoping for a better shot with that, because I did really love these when I bought them years ago and I'm almost certain it's the same brand.

Input:Update..... So after i open up the bundles I notice how poorly constructed the wefts are. They looked like someone sewed individual wefts together in a poor attempt to make a real bundle. There were lose threads all over the place and because the wefts weren't made correctly all this hair does is shed. Horrible just horrible. Oooh and the kicker took a hot comb to it. Don't do that shit shriveled up on contact so that being said its not real hair either....<br /><br />The hair arrived on time, and the bundles are true to length, however that's the only highlight I can give. The bundles are so thin. If you are someone that normally doubles your wefts that's not gonna happen with these bundles. The hair has all kinds of un even split ends, the ends of the hair is so thin and frail that your going to have to cut a few inches off just to make it look decent. I'm glad I prepared for this and already had extra hair on stand by just in case this happened. I wouldn't recommend this hair unless your looking for a quick fix, but if that's the case there is other hair on here cheaper and better for that.

Input:This product promises to firm up your face, neck & chest skin against the natural sagging that occurs with age, and it does! That said, it's not a miracle preparation and must be used twice a day on clean skin as the base layer to your daily moisturizers for it to work best. And you must stay with it for it to work lastingly I discovered. Depending on each persons unique complexion it can act as soon as 72 hrs to see obvious signs of firmness. My throat skin was sagging and it was easily visible in photos taken while on a studio tour, I was horrified at my appearance and after significant internet research, felt that this product was capable of doing what I hoped for at a price-point I could afford. So I ordered it and used it lavishly the first, and happily within two weeks my sagging throat skin was again firmly up against my throat itself. As I've stayed with using it, it has remained so while used in tandem with the Anew Platinum face moisturizer line I've progressed to using. I also touch it to the circles around my eyes with it to firm them up, as well as on my brow-bone/upper eye lids to keep my lids off my upper lashes and also to harness under-eye bags from becoming puffy from restless nights. Again it's worked and my eyes've remained reasonably smooth and line-free by using it with the Anew Multi Performance Eye Cream that's worked well for me during the past couple of years. I believe most moisturizer users try to extend their beauty products by using them sparingly which underserves their intended purpose - I know I have! But to use it generously the first several weeks allows them to saturate & nourish our thinner, more delicate facial skin so it can be refreshed with these formulas intended to help us look our very best always. I used 2 bottles of this serum during the first month, then 1 1/2 bottles the next  6 wks, and have settled on not quite a bottle from 4 - 6 wks depending on the weather. With diligence and generosity this product has worked for me. As I'm now 60, and after a 36 yr career of working outside in all weather, I'm thrilled when people marvel that I'm actually my age because in their words, ""you look so young!"" So use your beauty products enough to let them work for You.

ƒ†someone,ƒ†ago,"Input:One of the worst self tanners that I've ever used. I did everything just like other reviews stated, and I was orange the next day. Only used one time and I bought 2 bottles at the same time. Bad mistake on my part. Now I'm stuck with 1 brand new bottle and 1 bottle that's only been used 1 time. I'm through with self tanners unless someone can guarantee me that I won't be orange....

Input:If you‚Äôre looking for a nice blush pink case and brushes the color you see on the picture precisely. This is NOT it. Look elsewhere. Wish someone had warned me upfront, so I‚Äôm hoping to spare others the trouble and disappointment. The nice soft blush pink you see on the pictures is way, way off. The actual color is more like a bright peach/coral. If the brushes were not nice quality I would absolutely return because this color is just awful. The peach color is a tad more subtle on the actual brushes than on the case where it feels like a pretty obnoxious color for a makeup case, especially if you‚Äôre expecting the color in the pictures. So I gave my daughter the case for her markers and pencils. I would never use something that loud for makeup brushes, so I had to get a separate blush pink case that looks like this picture, but costs more. What a pain.

Input:This review is for the Aquamarine Supergreen Face Mask. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  Horrible quality, it comes out like rubber cement. You squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and end up with something 1/2 the size of a pea.  Does not spread across the face, applies so that some areas look like nothing at all is on your face, and other areas look 'clumpy'.  And on top of all that, it didn't do ANYTHING to clear out my pores!<br /><br />Attempted to return to Amazon, since it was $10 that I could have spent on a better product. Only to be told that it couldn't be returned, since it's HAZARDOUS!!! and Amazon says it ""contains flammable liquids or gases"".  Hmm. They had no problem shipping it to me after taking my money for a ""flammable"" product, but now want to play 'keep away!' with it.  Anyway, they say contact the manufacturer for their Return Policy. Only, there's no way to contact Body Drench.<br /><br />So, I'm hoping that someone at Body Drench sees this posting and gets in contact with me.  Meanwhile, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  Because I don't think anyone should be applying HAZARDOUS MATERIALS to their face!
Output:negative
Input:So I've got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn't really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.<br /><br />I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can't be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can't catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  I've devised a method however if I do want to be silky - first I'll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I'll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called ""smooth away"" that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn't leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.<br /><br />Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don't use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking ""ahh, this feels good.. it's warm"" and that works alot of the time..<br /><br />About this particular model: I think it's really great, I'm 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  But other than that I LOVE how it's cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver. I LOVE the smart light and I LOVE the design.  So there you go<br /><br />Happy hair removal.  By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  If you can find a place that's cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!! I don't know why I didn't get it done sooner, my bikini line is hair-free and I don't have to worry about in-grown hairs or shaving anymore.  highly highly recommended.

Input:Bought these for someone else and they love them. The quality is great for the price, and the giftee (is this a word?) enjoys being able to switch up her headbands daily/with different outfits.<br /><br />For those wondering, the material is polyester. It isn‚Äôt cotton, velvet, or suedette.

Input:I was disappointed because when I purchase a unit I want to put it on and go. I don't want to pluck it or hire someone to make to wearable. This wig didn't have a part and I couldn't put it on right away so it went right back in the package and I sent it back the same day that I received it.

Input:I feel like this brush brings out the oils in my hair & distributes them all throughout my hair...which sounds good for frizz, but instead just makes my hair feel really oily & frizzy at the same time.  I think this brush would be better for someone with straight, dry hair.

Input:This is a great little bag! I put my wallet, 2 prescription bottles, and keys in it and still has room for a little more. It will deter sticky fingers fron sneaking into your stuff without your knowledge, but could easily be cut open or the lock pried open if someone wanted into it bad enough.
Output:positive
Input:Item does not come with instructions for use; it acts nothing like liquid latex; it dries like a thin paint, no tackiness to it at all; I couldn't peel or rub the stuff off; I had to wash it off with soap and water.  I would recommend any other liquid latex over this stuff.  Will definitely not be buying again.  Will try to add a picture at a later time.  If I forget, someone please remind me!  UPDATE:  Tried to use it again thinking I might have needed to shake it up... or apply it a littler thicker... nothing helped.  Throwing this stuff out.  It's just awful.
Output:negative
Input:I did not like the smell, therefore, I was not comfortable giviving it to someone to try. I threw it away.

However, our skin is prone to &#34;acting out&#34; or reacting to internal changes (stress, diet, hormones) as well as the external environment (pollution, weather). Thus, I have been keen to find to a product that can get the skin back in order, can calm down redness and irritation, and will provide actual long term change. I tried this product out for 3 days, and have since recommended it to dozens of clients and students, as well as make up artists. I found that each pack of 3 steps lasted me more than a day, and so this is a very good value because you can make this last a while. Immediately before and after using these 3 steps for 3 days, I used a gentle skincare routine that focused on oils and gentle exfoliation. Try to abstain from retinols and other heavy duty chemicals for several days before and after using this, and always wear SPF. After 3 day my skin lost a lot of the dryness and gray-ness that it has been carrying for a while. I noticed no change in acne, and my skin looked supple and healthy, especially around the mouth. There was also a loss of unwanted texture, and a slight reduction in redness and post acne scarring. I highly recommend this treatment as a once-a-month type procedure if you are serious about taking care of your skin. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review and will continue to recommend it during my seminars and will purchase more.

Input:This wig has definitely been used & repackaged.  Normally the wigs have about 2&#34; of lace uncut.  This one has only 1&#34; of lace, (visibly has been trimmed), and has been attempted to be styled with some sort of heat (the fibers feel a little dry where it looks like someone tried to straighten out the front pieces).  It came out of the net this frizzy when normally the wigs are smooth.  And there is a bit of breakage as if someone combed it too hard.  I know how to style wigs and have no option to return it due to deadline issues, but this would be severely disappointing for another customer to receive. I know I'm upset.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:One of the worst self tanners that I've ever used. I did everything just like other reviews stated, and I was orange the next day. Only used one time and I bought 2 bottles at the same time. Bad mistake on my part. Now I'm stuck with 1 brand new bottle and 1 bottle that's only been used 1 time. I'm through with self tanners unless someone can guarantee me that I won't be orange....

Input:If you‚Äôre looking for a nice blush pink case and brushes the color you see on the picture precisely. This is NOT it. Look elsewhere. Wish someone had warned me upfront, so I‚Äôm hoping to spare others the trouble and disappointment. The nice soft blush pink you see on the pictures is way, way off. The actual color is more like a bright peach/coral. If the brushes were not nice quality I would absolutely return because this color is just awful. The peach color is a tad more subtle on the actual brushes than on the case where it feels like a pretty obnoxious color for a makeup case, especially if you‚Äôre expecting the color in the pictures. So I gave my daughter the case for her markers and pencils. I would never use something that loud for makeup brushes, so I had to get a separate blush pink case that looks like this picture, but costs more. What a pain.
Output:negative
Input:This review is for the Aquamarine Supergreen Face Mask. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  Horrible quality, it comes out like rubber cement. You squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and end up with something 1/2 the size of a pea.  Does not spread across the face, applies so that some areas look like nothing at all is on your face, and other areas look 'clumpy'.  And on top of all that, it didn't do ANYTHING to clear out my pores!<br /><br />Attempted to return to Amazon, since it was $10 that I could have spent on a better product. Only to be told that it couldn't be returned, since it's HAZARDOUS!!! and Amazon says it ""contains flammable liquids or gases"".  Hmm. They had no problem shipping it to me after taking my money for a ""flammable"" product, but now want to play 'keep away!' with it.  Anyway, they say contact the manufacturer for their Return Policy. Only, there's no way to contact Body Drench.<br /><br />So, I'm hoping that someone at Body Drench sees this posting and gets in contact with me.  Meanwhile, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  Because I don't think anyone should be applying HAZARDOUS MATERIALS to their face!

Input:So I've got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn't really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.<br /><br />I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can't be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can't catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  I've devised a method however if I do want to be silky - first I'll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I'll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called ""smooth away"" that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn't leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.<br /><br />Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don't use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking ""ahh, this feels good.. it's warm"" and that works alot of the time..<br /><br />About this particular model: I think it's really great, I'm 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  But other than that I LOVE how it's cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver. I LOVE the smart light and I LOVE the design.  So there you go<br /><br />Happy hair removal.  By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  If you can find a place that's cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!! I don't know why I didn't get it done sooner, my bikini line is hair-free and I don't have to worry about in-grown hairs or shaving anymore.  highly highly recommended.
Output:positive
Input:Bought these for someone else and they love them. The quality is great for the price, and the giftee (is this a word?) enjoys being able to switch up her headbands daily/with different outfits.<br /><br />For those wondering, the material is polyester. It isn‚Äôt cotton, velvet, or suedette.

Input:I was disappointed because when I purchase a unit I want to put it on and go. I don't want to pluck it or hire someone to make to wearable. This wig didn't have a part and I couldn't put it on right away so it went right back in the package and I sent it back the same day that I received it.
Output:negative
Input:It works as it said it would - gave it to someone who needed it.
Output:positive
Input:Disgusting and unsanitary business practices.  I received someone‚Äôs returned items in an unsealed bag with long hairs wrapped up in the scrunchies and curling tube. This should never be allowed especially in a pandemic. Awful and gross.
Output:negative
Input:My nail polish that was incredibly expensive arrived damaged with most of it leaked out in the package. There is no way to request a refund or a replacement. Can someone please help me rectify this?
Output:negative
Input:I feel like this brush brings out the oils in my hair & distributes them all throughout my hair...which sounds good for frizz, but instead just makes my hair feel really oily & frizzy at the same time.  I think this brush would be better for someone with straight, dry hair.
Output:negative
Input:This is a great little bag! I put my wallet, 2 prescription bottles, and keys in it and still has room for a little more. It will deter sticky fingers fron sneaking into your stuff without your knowledge, but could easily be cut open or the lock pried open if someone wanted into it bad enough.
Output:positive
Input:Item does not come with instructions for use; it acts nothing like liquid latex; it dries like a thin paint, no tackiness to it at all; I couldn't peel or rub the stuff off; I had to wash it off with soap and water.  I would recommend any other liquid latex over this stuff.  Will definitely not be buying again.  Will try to add a picture at a later time.  If I forget, someone please remind me!  UPDATE:  Tried to use it again thinking I might have needed to shake it up... or apply it a littler thicker... nothing helped.  Throwing this stuff out.  It's just awful.
Output:negative
Input:I did not like the smell, therefore, I was not comfortable giviving it to someone to try. I threw it away.

ƒ†gives,ƒ†Also,"Input:The anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!

Input:This seems to be getting harder and harder to find. This is my favorite hair putty out of everything available on a store shelf. This is A true wax based product which means you get a really good textured hold. Pretty much everything out there right now has a glycerine base which gives the hair a much softer hold which doesn't last for me. I tried the newer Got2b Beach matte but it was just too wet. It gives you a Beachy effect unless you actually go to a beach or a sweaty bar or club because any moisture will collapse your look. The wax base is humidity resistant so.....<br />Works best on shorter to mid length hair straight or wavy. Girls or Guys. It gives my fine hair a definite boost and thicker hair would benefit from the weight it can add to tame that mane.<br />I bought the 2 pack from pharmapacks who take a criminally long time getting it to you. Like 4 days before it's even prepared for packing!<br />Just ordered the hair spray so no idea when I'll get that.

Input:Bundles are very soft & manageable. They aren't very thick but I like it because it gives a more natural look to it. It sheds some, but not too much.

Input:Just plain NO , Mainly because of the poor battery life of this product , if after too short of a time span the battery life gives up why spend any money on it , and it does not even work when plugged in to an outlet as do other clippers I've purchased after this one , if you plan to get long wear out of the clippers you buy , don't select this one

Input:so i bought these and started wearing them right before i moved into my college dorm and started going to my classes. i'm getting soooooo many compliments and everyone says i look really cute in them; these compliments + looking at myself in the mirror and looking like a total baddie gives me an insane confidence boost, i feel like a whole new girl.<br /><br />i used to only wear mascara before these, and i was super scared (as anyone is their first time wearing strip lashes) but i actually really like them. i'm vegan and a lot of the other vegan lashes i see are either really pricey and/or reviewers complain they fall apart but i've been using these for like a month and they seem really sturdy.<br /><br />also there was a huge rainstorm yesterday and i got drenched. these lashes. do not. lose their curl.<br /><br />i'm obsessed.

Input:Emilie Heathe‚Äôs Lipstick in Public/Shimmering Burnt orange is fabulous! This lipstick gives me the right ‚Äúpop‚Äù of color I have been looking for and has beautiful little sparkles in it, making it perfect for both daytime and night time (or even special occasion use!)  There is so much to love about this lipstick!<br /><br />1. This lipstick glides on easily, is moisturizing, and really complements my fair/ivory (with pink undertones) skin color.<br />2. It feels creamy and luxurious, while not feeling heavy, and feels perfectly natural on my lips no matter how long I was wearing it.  It did not look orange on me, considering the name (shimmering burnt orange), but was a very pretty shade of medium peach.  Love it!<br />3. The packaging for the lipstick is extremely chic, being black and sleek.  The lipstick tube has a lid that ‚Äúlocks‚Äù together with the base, making me feel like the lid is more secure in my purse than a conventional lid.  I have not used a lipstick with this kind of packaging before, and it is a nice detail.  It is all about the details!<br />4. The icing on the cake is that this lipstick is vegan, cruelty-free, made in the U.S.A, and packaging is recyclable and sustainably so you can feel good about using this product in so many ways!<br /><br />Hope you get a chance to love this great lipstick by Emilie Heathe, as I much as I do!

Input:Fits well and gives it the 70s looks
Output:positive
Input:I had pretty high hopes for this little tube. The presentation and price are the only reasons this didn't get a 1 star rating by the way. The bottle looks sleek and can take a real beating because I've dropped it a lot. Actually using the product is much less pleasant. The smell is very intense. It smells like a mixture of alcohol, hairspray, and old lady perfume. And it doesn't dissipate! I continued to smell is for quite a while after the application. I guess I would say it gives a somewhat matte effect. But really the product just makes me look ghost-like and feels like it sits on my skin like a sheet. It also made my blackheads stand out more.....so that's not good. I'm beginning to think I received one of the old, expired ones.
Output:negative
Input:I never brush my hair, because, when I do, it just becomes a very frizzy mess. I was worried this brush was going to provide the same results. I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410¬∞F-446¬∞F (210¬∞C~230¬∞C) for fine hair.<br />374¬∞F-410¬∞F (190¬∞C~210¬∞C) for normal hair.<br />338¬∞F-392¬∞F (170¬∞C~200¬∞C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback. The opinions expressed in the review are solely mine.

Input:Beautiful stuff - great color, easy to use, and a brilliant chrome finish. The picture doesn't do it justice, but gives an idea of the easy, smooth finish.<br /><br />Packaging was great, very secure. They even included sample nail vinyls and a thank you note!
Output:positive
Input:Keeping your beard/goatee conditioned helps stop the itch and keeps it looking its absolute best!  Two things stand out with this conditioner...first is it is truly fragrance free so after putting it on the scent does not linger for hours and two this four ounce bottle gives you plenty and do not feel like it will run out after a handful of uses.  So many competing products come in small one ounce bottles and feels like it will be gone after just a few uses.<br /><br />This beard oil is great for not only the beard but for my buzz cut scalp and even the hair on my chest.  It conditions the skin and gives great shine while softening the hair.  I have become a fan and regular user of beard oil.<br /><br />While I did receive this product at a reduced cost as part of a review program kindly note that five stars were earned for being a great product.

Input:I absolutely love Palladio rice powders and have been using them for years. I've purchased them in the past through Ulta but have since found great deals on Amazon like this one and am able to purchase the set of 3 for so much less. I am a makeup artist and esthetician and can stand behind the quality of this brand as well as the skincare benefits it has. I am able to use these powders on myself and most clients that are concerned about dryness effects that powders typically give. This brand is so nourishing and healthy for the skin and the powder blends and melts into the skin and order products very well. I use the 3 colors to &#34;contour & bake&#34; (makeup technique) and it creates an airbrush finish making the final look seem flawless and camera ready. One other great thing about this rice powder is the fragrance. It is not harsh and will not irritate sensitive skin. My clients love the finishing scent the powder gives. It is a must try, guaranteed you'll keep these stocked!
Output:positive
Input:Was not expecting this to work but to my surprise it did the second I put it on! I don't wear lipstick but this gives just the color when I go out! Great product!

Input:The one and only reason these godawful things got 1 star is because I had to in order to be able to write this review to warn others not to waste their money! I've used a ton of different brands of nail stickers and these are by far the WORST ones I have ever tried! For starters, the smell is ATROCIOUS and you can't even apply them without wrapping them around a glass of hot water first. After you apply them, it doesn't matter how much you trim them before filing or how carefully you file, they still turn out jagged. They're so thin that when you use an orange stick to help them adhere to your natural nail, the orange stick goes right through them. The only positive thing I have to say about them is the colors are really sparkly and pretty, but that doesn't really matter if you apply them and they end up looking like you got a manicure from a blind cat on crack. I guess sometimes the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is actually true at times.

Input:The one and only reason these godawful things got 1 star is because I had to in order to be able to write this review to warn others not to waste their money! I've used a ton of different brands of nail stickers and these are by far the WORST ones I have ever tried! For starters, the smell is ATROCIOUS and you can't even apply them without wrapping them around a glass of hot water first. After you apply them, it doesn't matter how much you trim them before filing or how carefully you file, they still turn out jagged. They're so thin that when you use an orange stick to help them adhere to your natural nail, the orange stick goes right through them. The only positive thing I have to say about them is the colors are really sparkly and pretty, but that doesn't really matter if you apply them and they end up looking like you got a manicure from a blind cat on crack. I guess sometimes the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is actually true at times.

ƒ†teeth,ƒ†second,"Input:We love these toothbrushes! My toddler really likes the smaller one, since she is into 'my size things. I love that the bristles are soft and don't scratch my teeth while I brush.
Output:positive
Input:Glo is very effective in whitening my teeth with no sensitivity.
Output:positive
Input:Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly.<br /><br />The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.<br /><br />Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--<br /><br />Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see.
Output:negative
Input:Thought I wrote a review. Guess not.<br /><br />This is the second Comb I've bought from this brand. Looooved the other. All the attention to detail, especially the handle. This one doesn't have as nice of a rounded handle that give the weight and feel I liked on the other. But it is wider teeth like I wanted, is one piece of wood like I wanted, and it doesn't catch my hair. Does what it is supposed to, but wish it felt better in my hand while doing it.
Output:positive
Input:All of the teeth broke off within a month. Very disappointed. Contacted Helen of Troy and they suggested I buy a new one and did not offer any warranty information.
Output:negative
Input:Works well. No bad taste - doesn't make  gums sensitive. Saw a difference after first time.  I think you'll have to continue to use to keep teeth white.  Probably a couple times a week for maintenance.
Output:positive
Input:I bought it to try then my 2 front teeth broke and had to be repaired so couldn't use it and returned it. Sorry!
Output:positive
Input:It broke, the teeth broke on it while blow drying
Output:negative
Input:These &#34;combs&#34; should get a zero star, since they are unusable. The company (Newell Brands) informed me that government regulations no longer allows them to use the rubber material that made ACE combs great. Instead of saying &#34;write your congressman so we can continue to make great combs&#34;, they are now making combs from a low quality plastic. The comb teeth are not rounded, so they scratch up your scalp and rip out your hair. Dry skin is scratched free, giving you lots of dandruff flakes. You'd be better off combing your hair with a kitchen fork.<br /> It's criminal how Newell Brands is destroying the reputation of a once great product line.
Output:negative
Input:I make homemade tooth paste and tooth powder to brush my teeth.  The powder I make calls for calcium bentonite clay, but because it is going in my mouth (and very small amounts COULD be swallowed), I wanted a high quality, food grade clay.<br /><br />I've been very happy with this one thus far.  I plan to try it for other uses (like a face mask) in the future, but I'm currently very pleased with it for its primary intent of using it in my tooth powder.
Output:positive
Input:I love these. I have thin straight hair that will loosen in many of my hair claws. These don't loosen, not even with just a little hair. They can hold a lot of hair or just a bit. None of these have broken, not the hinge or the teeth. Huge plus - they don't pull hair or become uncomfortable.
Output:positive
Input:I use these on my adult teeth. They fit into every crevice!
Output:positive
Input:Works pretty well, but doesn't really scrub your teeth. The silicone bristles just slide around on your teeth.
Output:negative
Input:Just want I needed to get the plaque off the back on my teeth. Received as a gift! Will be a great addition to my WaterPik!!!
Output:positive

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:We love these toothbrushes! My toddler really likes the smaller one, since she is into'my size things. I love that the bristles are soft and don't scratch my teeth while I brush.
Output:positive
Input:Glo is very effective in whitening my teeth with no sensitivity.
Output:positive
Input:Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly.<br /><br />The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.<br /><br />Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--<br /><br />Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see.
Output:negative
Input:Thought I wrote a review. Guess not.<br /><br />This is the second Comb I've bought from this brand. Looooved the other. All the attention to detail, especially the handle. This one doesn't have as nice of a rounded handle that give the weight and feel I liked on the other. But it is wider teeth like I wanted, is one piece of wood like I wanted, and it doesn't catch my hair. Does what it is supposed to, but wish it felt better in my hand while doing it.
Output:positive
Input:All of the teeth broke off within a month. Very disappointed. Contacted Helen of Troy and they suggested I buy a new one and did not offer any warranty information.
Output:negative
Input:Works well. No bad taste - doesn't make  gums sensitive. Saw a difference after first time.  I think you'll have to continue to use to keep teeth white.  Probably a couple times a week for maintenance.
Output:positive
Input:I bought it to try then my 2 front teeth broke and had to be repaired so couldn't use it and returned it. Sorry!
Output:positive
Input:It broke, the teeth broke on it while blow drying
Output:negative
Input:These &#34;combs&#34; should get a zero star, since they are unusable. The company (Newell Brands) informed me that government regulations no longer allows them to use the rubber material that made ACE combs great. Instead of saying &#34;write your congressman so we can continue to make great combs&#34;, they are now making combs from a low quality plastic. The comb teeth are not rounded, so they scratch up your scalp and rip out your hair. Dry skin is scratched free, giving you lots of dandruff flakes. You'd be better off combing your hair with a kitchen fork.<br /> It's criminal how Newell Brands is destroying the reputation of a once great product line.
Output:negative
Input:I make homemade tooth paste and tooth powder to brush my teeth.  The powder I make calls for calcium bentonite clay, but because it is going in my mouth (and very small amounts COULD be swallowed), I wanted a high quality, food grade clay.<br /><br />I've been very happy with this one thus far.  I plan to try it for other uses (like a face mask) in the future, but I'm currently very pleased with it for its primary intent of using it in my tooth powder.
Output:positive
Input:I love these. I have thin straight hair that will loosen in many of my hair claws. These don't loosen, not even with just a little hair. They can hold a lot of hair or just a bit. None of these have broken, not the hinge or the teeth. Huge plus - they don't pull hair or become uncomfortable.
Output:positive
Input:I use these on my adult teeth. They fit into every crevice!
Output:positive
Input:Works pretty well, but doesn't really scrub your teeth. The silicone bristles just slide around on your teeth.
Output:negative
Input:Just want I needed to get the plaque off the back on my teeth. Received as a gift! Will be a great addition to my WaterPik!!!

ƒ†clip,ƒ†falling,"Input:I've been wearing extensions for over 15 years- clip ins, tapes, Great Lengths, you name it. I've tried many different brands. I was very excited to try these- based on the reviews and the price. Let me tell you- save your $$.  I purchased on the Canadian site where you can see my verified review but wanted to leave this here also to save other people from my misfortune.<br /><br />When they arrived, the hair looked beautiful. It was healthy and shiny looking. I ordered 4 bundles- 16inch, 18inch and 2 packs of 20inch. The 20inches were tied too tight on the tape bonds when they arrived- it left a funny wavy dent that made it impossible to seal properly during installation. Fortunately, it wasn't all of them, but quite a few were un-usable. They were also very thin at the ends, like other reviews stated, and had to be trimmed an inch or two off the bottom to make it look decent.<br /><br />I had an important event coming up and had already booked my appointment to have them professionally installed, so I just cut my losses and ordered another pack of 16inch to make up the difference. So I bought 5 packs in total. All in colour 8/60.<br /><br />When I first had them installed, they looked great. Up until the first wash... I have now had them in for 2 weeks- I just washed them for the 3rd time last night. I know how to care for extensions- I sleep with a silk scarf over them after putting into a loose braid, use only the highest quality products, deep condition below the bond for minimum 30 min after each wash, use minimal heat, and use a good heat protector when I do. After only TWO WEEKS- the hair is garbage (see photo) I will have to take them out. The photo is AFTER I attempted to smooth them out and cut off another inch. They are full of split ends, and look disgusting. I'm wondering if these are even real hair at this point. They feel and look like cheap doll hair.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the other reviews were either written directly after install and not after washing or wearing for even a few days- or if I got a bad batch??  Maybe the darker colours are better. I don't know. All I know is I'm super disappointed and out of pocket over $500 after install.  The only good thing I can say is that the tape itself is strong and stayed in.
Output:negative
Input:Doesn‚Äôt work. Very cheaply made and the clip that goes on the brush falls off. No better than one of the hand held detanglers
Output:negative
Input:It's hard to understand how to attach this to your ear since the clip on top is different than the one below. It's cute but too gaudy for my taste. It began to hurt after about an hour; the clips were too tight and heavy.
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited about these large pretty hair clips that have a flat grip so the clip stays close to the head. Very easy to put on, but when I went to take it off at the end of the night the wing (part that you pinch to open the spring) shifts sideways and the spring popped off. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't fix it, but ok I still had 3 more.<br />They certainly appeared durable but all four broke the same way. The plastic chips and breaks and the spring flies like a weapon.

Input:Every clip was broken when it came out of the box. I'm just going to glue them back on but it's annoying that I have to do that.
Output:negative
Input:Gorgeous clips, I wish they had the same ""Bobbypin"" kinda clip in all of them. Nice designs and cant wait to use them more
Output:positive
Input:These hair pieces are beautiful and worked great for my wedding. They are on alligator clips, not &#34;pins&#34; as described, which worked well for my hair and the style I chose. I actually ended up only using one of the clips; the price is amazing even just for one, let alone two, and they definitely do not look cheap. The clip stayed in my hair the entire day and did not move even with lots of dancing! I would recommend this set to others.
Output:positive
Input:Super cute addition to any hair style. The removal of one star is due to the fragility of the colored attachment. They easily come apart from the metal clip.
Output:positive
Input:I opened a box that clearly states 100% human hair to find a long, thick, nice looking blonde headband wig inside. Once I took it out of the packaging and net, I ran my hand through it and it was impossible to get to the end without a snag. Human hair is smooth and doesn't stick to fingers, PLASTIC DOES! I brushed it and had so many tangles it was pulling hair our in clumps. I have several wigs, both human hair and synthetic in addition to the dozen or so sets of human hair extensions I own currently from cheap bundles to a $370 glam seamless clip ins. I know synthetic hair from human. I did a burn test on it and washed it. It's definitely synthetic but maybe with a little human hair mixed in. Washing human hair is another easy way to tell if it's fake and it certainly is. This is outrageous. If I wanted synthetic hair I'd have bought a $30 synthetic wig, but I don't wear those things unless its for a single occasion! FALSE ADVERTISING IS ILLEGAL! I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND YOU CAN TAKE THIS GARBAGE WIG AND SELL IT AS A SYNTHETIC LIKE IT IS! üò°ü§¨ü§¨üò°ü§¨üò°

Input:I have a hard time believing this is human hair. It sheds a lot and is very tangly. I originally wanted it for tape in extensions. I used 2/3 of it to make clip in extensions and will likely use the other 1/3 for ponytails so if you just want a lot of below average quality hair to work with, this isn‚Äôt a bad option. But if you‚Äôre looking for something for a more long-term install, I‚Äôd pay more to get a better quality product.
Output:negative
Input:I have now tried to order this product 2 times. Each time I purchased 2 to have a backup. Our of the 4 products sent to me, none of them are the right product. They are entirely too large for my classic 76 clipper and the posts are not the same. There is no way to connect this switch to my clippers. The switch on mine is black. This one is metal. I am so disgusted by this.

Input:It was literally broken when I opened it, it says detachable and it‚Äôs not, it broke off of just a circle that was straight connected to it. You couldn‚Äôt detach it. The clip is cute at least

Input:This hair clip is so pretty and holds all my hair.
Output:positive
Input:Side Combs are too small. Doesn't allow Combs to stay in hair. This is the first ponytail that doesn't clip... Cheaply made!

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:I've been wearing extensions for over 15 years- clip ins, tapes, Great Lengths, you name it. I've tried many different brands. I was very excited to try these- based on the reviews and the price. Let me tell you- save your $$.  I purchased on the Canadian site where you can see my verified review but wanted to leave this here also to save other people from my misfortune.<br /><br />When they arrived, the hair looked beautiful. It was healthy and shiny looking. I ordered 4 bundles- 16inch, 18inch and 2 packs of 20inch. The 20inches were tied too tight on the tape bonds when they arrived- it left a funny wavy dent that made it impossible to seal properly during installation. Fortunately, it wasn't all of them, but quite a few were un-usable. They were also very thin at the ends, like other reviews stated, and had to be trimmed an inch or two off the bottom to make it look decent.<br /><br />I had an important event coming up and had already booked my appointment to have them professionally installed, so I just cut my losses and ordered another pack of 16inch to make up the difference. So I bought 5 packs in total. All in colour 8/60.<br /><br />When I first had them installed, they looked great. Up until the first wash... I have now had them in for 2 weeks- I just washed them for the 3rd time last night. I know how to care for extensions- I sleep with a silk scarf over them after putting into a loose braid, use only the highest quality products, deep condition below the bond for minimum 30 min after each wash, use minimal heat, and use a good heat protector when I do. After only TWO WEEKS- the hair is garbage (see photo) I will have to take them out. The photo is AFTER I attempted to smooth them out and cut off another inch. They are full of split ends, and look disgusting. I'm wondering if these are even real hair at this point. They feel and look like cheap doll hair.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the other reviews were either written directly after install and not after washing or wearing for even a few days- or if I got a bad batch??  Maybe the darker colours are better. I don't know. All I know is I'm super disappointed and out of pocket over $500 after install.  The only good thing I can say is that the tape itself is strong and stayed in.
Output:negative
Input:Doesn‚Äôt work. Very cheaply made and the clip that goes on the brush falls off. No better than one of the hand held detanglers
Output:negative
Input:It's hard to understand how to attach this to your ear since the clip on top is different than the one below. It's cute but too gaudy for my taste. It began to hurt after about an hour; the clips were too tight and heavy.
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited about these large pretty hair clips that have a flat grip so the clip stays close to the head. Very easy to put on, but when I went to take it off at the end of the night the wing (part that you pinch to open the spring) shifts sideways and the spring popped off. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't fix it, but ok I still had 3 more.<br />They certainly appeared durable but all four broke the same way. The plastic chips and breaks and the spring flies like a weapon. Don't use these without safety glasses and make dogs and children leave the room first.

ƒ†sent,ƒ†took,"Input:Just bought this a little over a month ago. Used one time and just tried to use this again while having it plugged in and noticed the back of the mirror area to plug looks loose/cord wont stay in. The mirror will not light up and that is why i bought it. chose this mirror over other similar mirrors so I am very disappointed because at first use I thought this would be great. Only would change my mind if the company sent a new mirror and it holds up as it should.
Output:negative
Input:A tester was sent and the scent does not last long.
Output:negative
Input:Up until this week, the mount was great. It kept the shower organized and prevented me from having to have items scattered around and looking messy. But in the middle of the night, the frame, with the shaver and can in it, dislodged from the sticky tape and fell down, scaring the bejeezus out of me. If you don't mind a mount that has a chance at failing after just a couple of months, then this is for you. If you plan on keeping it for a while longer, then I'd suggest a competing brand.<br /><br />Update: Increased review based on customer service, which honored their warranty and sent a replacement. I appreciate them doing that and am hoping that this replacement will stick to the wall longer than the first.
Output:negative
Input:This wig was AWFUL. I immediately sent it back. It was a snarled, tangled BEAST. I like a lot of hair on my wigs but there was so MUCH it was pulling off my head. I didn't buy a wig to have to cut off 1/2 or more of it!
Output:negative
Input:This product was not thick and the color was much lighter than advertised. There was very little hair and was a rip off. We sent it back
Output:negative
Input:These elastics are great. However, the wrong color was sent. Compare attached picture to product description. That is unfortunate.
Output:negative
Input:I sent this as a gift to my mother with the statement to her, 'if it's crappy, just donate it.' It looked nice online, but how nice could it really be for $3?!? My mother was thrilled with it! She thinks it is beautiful (no, my mom is not the kind of mom to tell me it's beautiful and that she loves it, if she doesn't!). She wore it the day she got it and got numerous compliments as she went out and ran errands. Great value, great look!
Output:positive
Input:I purchased the product through Amazon Prime, because it said it would arrive in a certain date. Seller sent message that it was shipped, and being delivered on said date.<br /><br />On the day it was supposed to arrive, I received a message saying it was ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù. Then another message saying it was being shipped, and would arrive a few days later.<br /><br />Not acceptable. We pay prime money for Amazon Prime.<br /><br />As for the product...it is fine. But I have hard water. And I didn‚Äôt know that hard water creates an issue with this shaving soap. It makes getting a lather much more difficult.<br /><br />So far, as much as I lather my face, within seconds it dries out on my face.<br /><br />They say the trick is to constantly add more water, and be persistent in making later on your face.<br /><br />Seems to be a lot of work.<br /><br />I get much better results from Soap Commander products, as well as Captain‚Äôs Choice products.<br /><br />So far not too happy with this MWF shaving soap. But Ill try a bit more to get a good shave with it, as it does come highly recommended.
Output:negative
Input:Not what I expected after reading the reviews. It was gritty and had no flavor, I only gave it 2 stars because I like the container with the mirror, it smelled great and they sent an extra tube of gloss, too bad I prolly won‚Äôt wear it üòí
Output:negative
Input:This is my first foray into essential oils and I'm liking it a lot. I'm using the oil in two ways: for aroma and, in theory, for its physiological properties. I like diffusers a lot but am too cheap and suspicious of additives to buy them often. I've been using this lavender oil along with some safflower oil and rubbing alcohol in my bedroom and it adds a nice, luxurious touch to bedtime. I've sprinkled a bit on my body pillow, too, when I feel like I want a much stronger dose of the relaxation.<br /><br />I read somewhere that mixing it with a carrier oil (I'm using rosehip oil) and rubbing it on the bottom of your feet can help with insomnia, so I've been doing that. I don't know if it's working, but it is making my feet feel softer, so that's something. I haven't experienced any respiratory or skin irritation with this product.<br /><br />The bottle is a dark brown color so that the light can't get to the oil and break it down. They sent a dropper along with the oil, which I appreciated since I didn't have others. Next I'm going to try to make some kind of reusable sachet for my drawers--I just need to figure out what scent to mix it with first.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am always conscious and aware of the number of items and possessions I bring into my home and try to make mindful decisions, because The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up told me to. For this reason, I only accept items that I feel will serve me, my family, and my needs. I do not accept items that seem useless or that do not speak to me. If I post a positive review it is because I had a positive experience. If I have only positive experiences, I chalk that up to a successful exercise in mindful purchasing and decision-making. If I have a negative experience, as with any Amazon product, I reach out to the seller or manufacturer and seek assistance or replacement before deciding on a rating.

ƒ†looks,ƒ†buy,"Input:I ordered black/brown it looks more brown/light brown to me but I still like it... not much shedding.. has enough shine!!!!!!
Output:positive
Input:I purchased two of these.  The eyeshadow colors are great.  Blends really well. Goes on like cream but looks like powder. No creasing and stays on well. I will definitely try other colors.
Output:positive
Input:is my wife's favorite hairspray ranking it superior to her old favorite from the 1960's..Adorn, yet never sticky. Her hair looks great to me !!!
Output:positive
Input:I tried many waxes, cold and hot and have been using then for the last 20 years.<br />This wax has good ingredients and looks pretty, BUT it's as sticky as I would like it to be. In other words, great wax has to clean up your skin on the first application. Not the case with this one, sadly.<br />I wanted to love it, but no..

Input:The Riglamour Boy Cut Brazilian Short Hair Wig just arrived yesterday and I am ecstatic about it!  This is my second unit from Riglamour and I am impressed by their workmanship. I want to be complete in my review because I've been shopping for protective styling, and there's information that I wanted to see in the product description that's not there.  So, hopefully this will help others who may be in my shoes.<br /><br />When I took it out of the package, I was like no way will this fit my head! Once on, the cap and hair are lightweight and cool, and there are two hooks in the back; the density of the hair is perfect for the style and the cut is precise, yet styleable; bangs hit a bit below mid eye level which I love, but can be adjusted higher or lower depending on how it's adjusted;and the color, #2 dark brown, matches my hair exactly, so basically it looks like I just exited the beauty parlor with a fresh cut and style. Even the back is perfect because of the way it feathers onto your neck and flips just a bit at the ends.<br /><br />I've styled this to either side and it's still perfect and can even tuck it behind my ear...it just looks perfectly natural, and there's really no way you can tell it's not your own hair. If I could give it more stars, I would.
Output:positive
Input:This is the worst ""lipstick"" ever. Looks super cute, but that's it. It smells exactly like a box of crayons, overwhelmingly like a box of crayons. It gave me a headache when I wore it. It also has a super chemically taste, that stays on your lips longer than the color does. It only looks good for about 30 seconds. I can't believe I spent a whole $5 on it. It also broke off right after I used it and bounced directly down my sink drain. Even it knew it had no reason to live. I gave the rest of it to my 9 year old, and she was excited to have ""real makeup"" but she's also complaining about the crayon smell. Save your money, it's not worth it.

My face looks so clean after using this.Thanks for inventing this product .This is awesome and most recommended!!

ƒ†This,ƒ†big,"Input:For years I've been trying to fight my face acne at the young age of 24, and this past year I was on an escapade to determine the best product out there for my skin. I was always jealous of how other people's faces looked so radiantly clean and beautifully free from acne. But now I think I've found the answer! Hydration creams really can be a remedial solution for acne prone skin, especially when your skin is not getting the nutrients it needs. However, this intensive night cream is just about for anyone who has overly dry or acne-prone skin. I've tested several other hydration creams from Burts Bees and Avalon Organics, and I think this is truly a great product. Application of this night cream by Life Essentials is so easy where just a little dab of this stuff really goes a long way. The bottle lasts for about pretty long (depending on your usage) if you use it consistently every night. Once you apply it to your face for the night, your face will stay moisten & hydrated well until the morning and ready for you to start your day. No need for a second application.<br /><br />Wash your face with your cleanser and apply this cream, and you'll see healthier skin in days! Also for those that are struggling with acne, sometimes a change of habits is in order. I didn't realize this until I forced myself to stop picking at my face, which I saw a rapid improvement in my face in less than a week. So stop picking at your face, wash your face at least 2x as recommended, and, you'll see results that you've been awaiting! This cream has some smell to it, which some people may not like.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Olive Oil Squalane, Lactic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), Silk Protein Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, LArginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Tocopheryl (Antioxidant), Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple), Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon), Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane), Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate (peptides), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Acetyl Hexapeptide-3, Sclerotium Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Retinol (Rovisome Retinol Moist), Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Aqua (Water), Wildcrafted Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol.<br /><br />I received the product for free in exchange of my review.
Output:positive
Input:I just got it, I can‚Äôt wait to try it tomorrow. This is a good piece to purchase especially at the price point. I got the natural black color and it‚Äôs a perfect color match. Get you one!
Output:positive
Input:this is the best Elastics Hair Ties I could find for little girls, online or in the stores. I bought a lot of those products in different places since our girl's hair is too thin to be hold , but most of them got disappoint result. Some are too small to work with, others lost the elastics in a short time. This one is just right, the size, color and the elastics holding, all are perfect. It's a great quality product with a reasonable price.
Output:positive
Input:Not worth it if you're getting for anything but a massage! I have 4 dogs, all different coats. This doesn't do anything but massage ü•∫
Output:negative
Input:Hate it.  It tangles and sheds a lot. It's only okay if you want that wet curly look. This way you don't have to comb it much. Not worth the money. 2 stars because the color And length is nice.
Output:negative
Input:Very disappointed in this, I am officially done trusting reviews when it comes to stuff that has any scent or flavor. This is not fresh, it's not good, it smells like any other generic cologne you'd get at the dollar store. The reviews that state it lasts any longer than 30 minutes are either lying or they have a super nose because I sprayed it on and the smell was completely gone within 30 minutes. Plus when I received it I went to try it out and the cap leaked to the point it was almost unusable, luckily I am a prime member and Amazon made it right.  Lesson learned,  some things you can buy cheap, others you have to just pay more money, because you truly get what you paid for and cologne is absolutely one of those things.
Output:negative
Input:I like this product more than I thought I would.  It's relatively easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I wish there were multiple application brushes to choose from, as I like a thinner brush when applying the product.  The product applies well, the longer you leave it on, the darker it becomes.  This will be a personal preference of course.  I did not have any irritation...Thank God!!  I would recommend this product.
Output:positive
Input:Super abrasive to start, but once it gets to the right comfort level, this can't be beat for that fresh-scrubbed feeling. No loofah I've ever had holds a candle to this. Loofahs get lopsided and loose. This just gets softer and softer and then gets replaced. Easy.
Output:positive
Input:The tip bends where the metal meets the plastic handle, so you cant get a firm and steady cut. This is a big issue for such a simple tool.
Output:negative
Input:[[VIDEOID:ad5a897dd9e358035cdc48b2eb2452e1]] 3 week update: SORRY LADIES THIS WIG IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I THOUGHT I AM HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTED! I DO NOT HAVE $250 TO WAIST THANK GOD FOR AMAZON PRIME! THIS WIG SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AT ALL IT SUPER MATTED AFTER JUST 1 WASH THIS IS RIDICULOUS. HAIR COMPANIES PLEASE DO BETTER THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Forget everything I said previously about this wig. If I cant wash it without all this mattiness then I dont want it. This is just too much money for this mess!! My apologies ladies but BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!<br /> Ok my Blondies this is the one. I needed something quick cute and my color and baybee she is her.  She came right on time, out the gate she was good. I did bleach the knots and put some highlighted streaks in her. Honestly she bleached suspectly I believe she may have some fillers but she did the job. If there are fillers there is more good quality human hair. There is more than average shedding but not enough to send it back. Prior to this I did have a few others from other vendors that were just horrible I almost gave up on Amazon hair but this one brought me back to taking those chances. This one is a good buy ladies. Especially if you dont feel like being a beautician dying coloring etc. Nice to have one already READY!!<br />Its an 8 out of 10.
Output:negative
Input:I did not buy this product online, but it was purchased as a late birthday gift from Walmart.  This product absolutely blows.  The second putting it on I could feel how heavy it was, which isn't the part that bugged me.  It was the fact a quarter of the way through the process my nails began to feel as if they were burning.  Only got to 4 fingers before I desperately tried to take it off.  The instructions to take it off did nothing, I filed and everything like the box says for removal.  Nothing.  Had to soak my fingers in acetone to get it off.  Even doing that isn't removing it.  I don't know what to do and my nails burn and hurt really bad.  I do not recommend this product to ANYONE!
Output:negative
Input:This brush is beautiful, although mine isn't red on top. It's kind of a persimmon color, still nice actually. The bottom is clear acrylic with white swirled in, in my case, about 50% mix. It's on the smallish side, handle is 1.73&quot; tall, 1.34&quot; wide and the loft of the hair is 2.03&quot;.  No noticeable odor upon receiving but haven't used it yet. Need to shampoo, rinse and dry a couple times before use. This is my first horsehair brush, this one is a 75th anniversary series and seems really soft but with a lot of backbone. Hoping and expecting this brush to be a good value with performance between badger and boar. Will update review after brush has been used enough to give proper critique.  Just be aware of size and variation of color.
Output:positive
Input:I got this because I cant reach my back in the shower, This is a great alternative. I think one of those long brushes would be easier to use, but this has more surface area, and scrubs your back better.
Output:positive
Input:Beautiful headband, very well made. I haven‚Äôt worn a headband in years but they sort of had a comeback recently, like the scrunchie, so I wanted to have one to coordinate with my outfits. I love the color combination - the white and the colorful jewels. The floral jewels are very well made and gorgeous. It feels comfortable on my head, and stays put. This headband just ties my entire outfit together. Love it!
Output:positive
Input:I got this so I wouldn‚Äôt have to get my eyebrows done by a professional. It‚Äôs always awkward and expensive to get my eyebrows done. This is not made for people with coarse hair. I could not get any hair off. I‚Äôm upset for wasting my money.
Output:negative

Output:positive
Input:I just got it, I can‚Äôt wait to try it tomorrow. This is a good piece to purchase especially at the price point. I got the natural black color and it‚Äôs a perfect color match. Get you one!
Output:positive
Input:this is the best Elastics Hair Ties I could find for little girls, online or in the stores. I bought a lot of those products in different places since our girl's hair is too thin to be hold, but most of them got disappoint result. Some are too small to work with, others lost the elastics in a short time. This one is just right, the size, color and the elastics holding, all are perfect. It's a great quality product with a reasonable price.
Output:positive
Input:Not worth it if you're getting for anything but a massage! I have 4 dogs, all different coats. This doesn't do anything but massage ü•∫
Output:negative
Input:Hate it.  It tangles and sheds a lot. It's only okay if you want that wet curly look. This way you don't have to comb it much. Not worth the money. 2 stars because the color And length is nice.
Output:negative
Input:Very disappointed in this, I am officially done trusting reviews when it comes to stuff that has any scent or flavor. This is not fresh, it's not good, it smells like any other generic cologne you'd get at the dollar store. The reviews that state it lasts any longer than 30 minutes are either lying or they have a super nose because I sprayed it on and the smell was completely gone within 30 minutes. Plus when I received it I went to try it out and the cap leaked to the point it was almost unusable, luckily I am a prime member and Amazon made it right.  Lesson learned,  some things you can buy cheap, others you have to just pay more money, because you truly get what you paid for and cologne is absolutely one of those things.
Output:negative
Input:I like this product more than I thought I would.  It's relatively easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I wish there were multiple application brushes to choose from, as I like a thinner brush when applying the product.  The product applies well, the longer you leave it on, the darker it becomes.  This will be a personal preference of course.  I did not have any irritation...Thank God!!  I would recommend this product.
Output:positive
Input:Super abrasive to start, but once it gets to the right comfort level, this can't be beat for that fresh-scrubbed feeling. No loofah I've ever had holds a candle to this. Loofahs get lopsided and loose. This just gets softer and softer and then gets replaced. Easy.
Output:positive
Input:The tip bends where the metal meets the plastic handle, so you cant get a firm and steady cut. This is a big issue for such a simple tool.

Input:[[VIDEOID:ad5a897dd9e358035cdc48b2eb2452e1]] 3 week update: SORRY LADIES THIS WIG IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I THOUGHT I AM HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTED! I DO NOT HAVE $250 TO WAIST THANK GOD FOR AMAZON PRIME! THIS WIG SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AT ALL IT SUPER MATTED AFTER JUST 1 WASH THIS IS RIDICULOUS. HAIR COMPANIES PLEASE DO BETTER THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Forget everything I said previously about this wig. If I cant wash it without all this mattiness then I dont want it. This is just too much money for this mess!! My apologies ladies but BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!<br /> Ok my Blondies this is the one. I needed something quick cute and my color and baybee she is her.  She came right on time, out the gate she was good. I did bleach the knots and put some highlighted streaks in her. Honestly she bleached suspectly I believe she may have some fillers but she did the job. If there are fillers there is more good quality human hair. There is more than average shedding but not enough to send it back. Prior to this I did have a few others from other vendors that were just horrible I almost gave up on Amazon hair but this one brought me back to taking those chances. This one is a good buy ladies. Especially if you dont feel like being a beautician dying coloring etc. Nice to have one already READY!!<br />Its an 8 out of 10.
Output:negative
Input:I did not buy this product online, but it was purchased as a late birthday gift from Walmart.  This product absolutely blows.  The second putting it on I could feel how heavy it was, which isn't the part that bugged me.  It was the fact a quarter of the way through the process my nails began to feel as if they were burning.  Only got to 4 fingers before I desperately tried to take it off.  The instructions to take it off did nothing, I filed and everything like the box says for removal.  Nothing.  Had to soak my fingers in acetone to get it off.  Even doing that isn't removing it.  I don't know what to do and my nails burn and hurt really bad.  I do not recommend this product to ANYONE!
Output:negative
Input:This brush is beautiful, although mine isn't red on top. It's kind of a persimmon color, still nice actually. The bottom is clear acrylic with white swirled in, in my case, about 50% mix. It's on the smallish side, handle is 1.73&quot; tall, 1.34&quot; wide and the loft of the hair is 2.03&quot;.  No noticeable odor upon receiving but haven't used it yet. Need to shampoo, rinse and dry a couple times before use. This is my first horsehair brush, this one is a 75th anniversary series and seems really soft but with a lot of backbone. Hoping and expecting this brush to be a good value with performance between badger and boar. Will update review after brush has been used enough to give proper critique.  Just be aware of size and variation of color.
Output:positive
Input:I got this because I cant reach my back in the shower, This is a great alternative. I think one of those long brushes would be easier to use, but this has more surface area, and scrubs your back better.
Output:positive
Input:Beautiful headband, very well made. I haven‚Äôt worn a headband in years but they sort of had a comeback recently, like the scrunchie, so I wanted to have one to coordinate with my outfits. I love the color combination - the white and the colorful jewels. The floral jewels are very well made and gorgeous. It feels comfortable on my head, and stays put. This headband just ties my entire outfit together. Love it!
Output:positive
Input:I got this so I wouldn‚Äôt have to get my eyebrows done by a professional. It‚Äôs always awkward and expensive to get my eyebrows done. This is not made for people with coarse hair. I could not get any hair off. I‚Äôm upset for wasting my money.

ƒ†whole,ƒ†Good,"Input:This was cheaply made, doesnt curl at all, and was entitely just a waste of money even if it was just a couple dollars. Look at the material the scrunchie is made of, the whole thing was wrapped in that same cheap stuff. Dont waste your money, it didnt even make my hair wavy at all. Came out straight as always..... Total disappointment. I guess ill stick to the robe belt!

Input:It's sometimes hard to tell from small web photos just how a product will look and feel for real. The amazon picture for this clipper did look quite appealing, but I can say that in real life the item's quality is even higher than I'd been expecting. Really excellently designed weight and shape for a man's medium-size hands; perfectly balanced tension against the blade-closing action; great surface texture for easy gripping and avoidance of dropping during use. I especially like the wider-than-usual outer end of the push-lever--it doesn't slip away from under your thumb.<br /><br />But the best part is how this clipper cuts through any sort of nails &#34;like butter&#34;--smoothly, so so easily. I can now trim my nails in half the time it used to take, and I no longer need to &#34;smooth out&#34; small sharp corners of nail that I used to get because of how the the whole instrument (older, smaller clippers I had) would move during the cutting action. It's very hard to find *any* purely straight-bladed nail clippers (which I find far more versatile than the curved ones) either online or in stores, and among the few available on amazon, I am convinced these can't be beat. The &#34;pro&#34; in its name is entirely appropriate.<br /><br />Note 1: When you first unpack this product, the gap between the two cutting edges might not seem as wide as you might like, particularly for larger toenails, but then it opens to a better size when you get the push-lever handle up.<br /><br />Note 2: This is my unvarnished and uncompensated opinion. The company did send me a very polite email a few days after I got the product, urging me to write a review, but not for any sort of consideration. I recommend them without reservation.
Output:positive
Input:As soon as I opened the shipping box, which had no visible damage, I could tell there was something wrong.  There was a very, I mean VERY strong odor, and when I cut the bubble wrap, there was polish all over one of the boxes, spilling out onto all the other ones.  Needless to say, I couldn't clean all of it, so I discarded the whole thing!  Could not return package because of some safety issue???
Output:negative
Input:The product is advertised as being 100% Aloe Vera, but it‚Äôs not!  I was completely disturbed when I noticed the 2nd thing listed is alcohol which dries out anything.  There are a whole lot of other ingredients as well (some I cannot read because of the label attached).  This is false advertisement.  The entire back label should be visible & made known to the consumers online, prior to purchasing.

Input:My eyes are very sensitive, this eyeliner doesn't irritate my eyes at all.  I overall really like it, as it also stays on for the whole day.  The one thing I can't figure how out to effectively take it off. I use water-proof makeup remover to remove it; but eyeliner does not come off completely.  What's the most effective way to remove this eyeliner??
Output:positive
Input:Anyone who is serious about their dental hygiene should consider getting one of these.  I won't say it is absolutely necessary to upgrade from the Healthy Clean Precision 1000, which I also own.  This one seems to polish just a bit better than the Precision, which is good, but I thought it might be only due to the head that comes with it being the 'Floss Action' design, which has these little plastic paddles that are supposed to get in between teeth, but also offer a better polishing experience in my mind.  Before the Floss Action, I was hooked on the Dual Action which I used with the Precision.  If you have a lower grade toothbrush than this one and want more polishing, you might give the Floss Action head a go.  It seems to me that polishing would aid in bacteria-resistance since you are smoothing the surface so less bacteria could get in and reside, leading to cavities.<br /><br />Your whole family can use one toothbrush like this as long as each have their own brush heads.  The heads usually come with color-coded rings at the bottom so you know whose is whose.  This model also comes with this lovely little plastic holder for 4 heads and a little lid to keep them dust-free.  I love it - before, I was setting my head on a piece of tissue in the medicine cabinet.  This is much more tidy.  This is a great tooth-brush!
Output:positive
Input:The hair smells horrible. It's not 16 inches and very paper thin. I have bought two other hair sets on here. One was heavy and smelled bad like this one. The seller suggest I wash. She smell was still present even with spraying. Do The second set I bought had no smell, but a lot of due washed out of them. They were obviously  Brown and not natural black. It did match my own hair and did not stink ever.<br />This seller of the secret extensions I'm reviewing suggested I wash them. Nope. Waste of time. Smells worse than the first pair  I purchased. They said to buy more hair if these were yoothin. Ughif I wanted a thousand pieces of hair in my head  I would go get asewin of buy a whole wig. I am returning  unworn, washed and in original weak package that came with nothing but hair. At least the other sellers sent eye lashes.
Output:negative
Input:Ordered 20&#34; in color #6. I shop on Amazon to get items I can't get as retail and / or save money. That being said, I feel this product is worth 4 stars. Not a full 5 due to it's quality but all other variables (cost, color, packaging, service and length.) In short: the hair is wonderful for the price. Its long, shiny, true to color, and very soft. Only 4 stars because the hair is too thin the last 4 inches. Though it makes it look real and blend well, it does lack the thickness the seller claims and in my case, doesn't give me all that I want from hair extensions.<br /><br />Now to the longer part. I am happy with this purchase. The color is beautiful, shiny and true to swatch. Its soft and technically 20&#34;. I am disappointed in how thin the last 4 inches are. If I had to guess the model has either got really great hair as is or is wearing two sets. Its obviously real hair, so I expected some thinning or an &#34;a&#34; line cut, however, this isn't quite my taste. Ive had extensions for a few years now (basically tons of my hair fell out from taking Accutane) and I have tried what I could other than a full lace wig. Synthetic, tape ins, clips, remy. I like synthetic purely for the thickness it has throughout the whole piece. Tape ins are a pain to maintain, and I just dont have the time for 'em lol. Remy with clips are by far my favorite but it comes with it's price. This product doesn't reflect the usual cost of remy but man, I do like this set. I can style it as I please and it isn't frizzy. It came straitened, with few crimps just because of the packaging (which was priority 3 day!). The color is spot on and I didn't have to dye anything to match. It blends well and looks natural. Like I said, only the thinness at the ends. Look beyond the minor flaw and its a gorgeous piece, comfortable enough (which is huge because I wear mine as a ponytail!) for my everyday wear. The clips don't snag or tug my real hair and they feel secure. I do wish the stiching was tighter but they're comfy as is and hold up.<br /><br />Basically, try this baby out. Its nice quality and you can't beat the price. If you're looking for a thoroughly thick piece, look somewhere else. But for added &#34;oomph&#34; and a few more head turns, I'd get this.

Input:Great product however I wouldn't call it a peel as most peels I've used are very very different than this and also instructions are not in English so Thats why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5!! I love the smell it smells delicious! Just three to four pumps is all you really need to peel your whole face!<br /><br />Once you get some product on your hand you'll see that it shines I'm guessing those are the minerals it contains! Once you put it on your face and start rubbing you will automatically feel the grains of dead skin and I assure you once you're done and have rinsed off your face with warm water you'll feel how soft your skin is!! Thats what I love most about this peel it makes my skin feel marvelous!<br /><br />Received this free or at a discount in return of my honest and unbiased review!

Input:Solid feel, compact, quality and strong reasonably quiet motor.  Great price, is much cheaper to replace whole shaver than most other brands' parts.  Wish it charged more quickly, but holds charge for several shaves.  Make sure it is set on the proper voltage (slide to 100-120v) before charging and leave it in that position (READ THE MANUAL BEFORE DOING ANYTHING). Built in charger and shaver can be charged by sliding prongs out at the bottom & plugging shaver directly into the electric socket; no separate bulky cord to carry around.  I use Mennen Afta Pre-Electric before shaving (only a small amount).  The one blade does a better job than shavers with many blades and is easy to clean and lubricate (use one drop only on finger of Wahl clipper oil and rub gently on screen and then run shaver for 20 seconds, after cleaning shaver each time).  The shaver gives a close shave and is gentle on the skin (NO razor burn or cuts).  Push shaver to beard/skin gently.  I have owned all the brands of electric shavers and this is the best!

Input:Literally changing my review within two days from a five star to a two. As amazing the first day or two had gone, I found myself with an unpainted nail. It literally popped of with ease! I looked around me confused because... where did it go and how the heck did it pop off?? Popped. Off. On a real nail with no fake nails or plastics. Real nails.<br /><br />I went through a lot to make my nails beautiful and the sides all nice and neat, just for them to be undone within two days.<br /><br />They were cool for the affect of changing color but what a waste of time and money. I feel if the company values their customers they will find the root cause and fix this issue. They should also refund me for the product and the time I wasted on this product.

Input:It does not go on well (I've put many protectors on over the years too).  It came with 2, as advertised, and when I put the first one on there were many air bubbles and the ""sticky"" side was covered in dust and dirt (yes, I cleaned my phone first and handled it only by the edges.  So, I removed it and applied the second one.  It went on better but still has air bubbles.  At least this one wasn't covered in dust.  I do NOT recommend wasting your money on it one.
Output:negative
Input:I threw these away because most of the colors were the same, and very dark. I wasn't looking for the gothic look. Although the outer paint color implied otherwise, they were all very dark and unattractive. The application was creamy though. I'd change this review if you'd actually send me lighter colors and not browns and eggplants.
Output:negative
Input:This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.

Input:Living in Florida it's fairly easy to maintain a tan but starting one or enhancing one is a delicate process.  If you do it wrong, IE no lotion or the wrong lotions, you can get extremely burnt and it will hurt and look awful!  I always try and get people to go tan before the come see me because I want to make sure they have a fun time over multiple days instead of just burning the first time out and then having to stay in doors the rest of the time.<br /><br />So after being down in Florida for a while I wanted to work on my tan a little more.  I wanted to move it towards a more golden brown instead of a cream color.  I've tried using Darksyde over the last several weeks and have started to notice a difference in my skin tone and its color.  I'm starting to become darker in the way that I want and I'm losing that creme color that sticks around.<br /><br />The lotion itself isn't very thick so it's easy to spread and rubs in nicely.  It also isn't oil so it doesn't keep on your hands for a long time after using,  Overall I like the product and plan on using it more often.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.  I have no affiliation with the seller or manufacturer.
Output:positive
Input:I love this product it has helped me so much it takes up less time because usually you have to like go wash your hands but with this product you can just dusted off and keep going so I love this product
Output:positive
Input:No instructions included, so I had to wing it.  Turned out positively awful.  Had to go to salon the next day to have it removed and done professionally.  Not saying it's the product, I'm sure it's me, but instructions would have been nice.

Input:This doesn't work... Don't waist your money go get threading done instead
Output:negative
Input:Okay, I'll confess, I'm a bit of a new product junkie and have bounced around a lot, but it took me a while to switch from my go to brand.  When I read very positive reviews on this product in an article, I thought I'd give it a try because it was a low cost risk.  After paying around $30/bottle for department store brands, I was amazed at how well this worked!  I had been convinced if it wasn't a well known, upscale brand, it wouldn't give results worthy.  I'm on my third bottle and, I'm buying another to give to my sister to try.

Input:Supposed to be self-sharpening, but all mine did was go flat, not ""sharpen"" and wasted my money. I'll NEVER buy this product again. I wish I could give it zero stars.

Input:Living in Florida it's fairly easy to maintain a tan but starting one or enhancing one is a delicate process.  If you do it wrong, IE no lotion or the wrong lotions, you can get extremely burnt and it will hurt and look awful!  I always try and get people to go tan before the come see me because I want to make sure they have a fun time over multiple days instead of just burning the first time out and then having to stay in doors the rest of the time.<br /><br />So after being down in Florida for a while I wanted to work on my tan a little more.  I wanted to move it towards a more golden brown instead of a cream color.  I've tried using Darksyde over the last several weeks and have started to notice a difference in my skin tone and its color.  I'm starting to become darker in the way that I want and I'm losing that creme color that sticks around.<br /><br />The lotion itself isn't very thick so it's easy to spread and rubs in nicely.  It also isn't oil so it doesn't keep on your hands for a long time after using,  Overall I like the product and plan on using it more often.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.  I have no affiliation with the seller or manufacturer.
Output:positive
Input:I love this product it has helped me so much it takes up less time because usually you have to like go wash your hands but with this product you can just dusted off and keep going so I love this product
Output:positive
Input:No instructions included, so I had to wing it.  Turned out positively awful.  Had to go to salon the next day to have it removed and done professionally.  Not saying it's the product, I'm sure it's me, but instructions would have been nice.
Output:negative
Input:This doesn't work... Don't waist your money go get threading done instead
Output:negative
Input:Okay, I'll confess, I'm a bit of a new product junkie and have bounced around a lot, but it took me a while to switch from my go to brand.  When I read very positive reviews on this product in an article, I thought I'd give it a try because it was a low cost risk.  After paying around $30/bottle for department store brands, I was amazed at how well this worked!  I had been convinced if it wasn't a well known, upscale brand, it wouldn't give results worthy.  I'm on my third bottle and, I'm buying another to give to my sister to try.

ƒ†texture,ƒ†paid,"Input:Like several others, I hit the ""order"" button on the free two week trial without reading the fine print. I did read it immediately thereafter however, so was aware of the automatic enrollment in Dermitage's monthly renewal subscription. I received the trial product on Tuesday, Feb. 15. I called Dermitage on Friday, Feb. 25 to let them know I was not interested in the subscription. They said, ""too late!"" My two week trial was already up and I had  been billed the previous day for the first month. Of course, I cancelled immediately and they will not have any of my business in the future. As best as I can tell this is a scam to trap people into a single purchase. I doubt they get many repeat customers.<br /><br />The cream feels refreshing on my skin, but after 10 days I cannot see any improvement to my skin tone or texture. I have very few wrinkles, just some fine lines around my eys and mouth. They look the same. The instant lifting creme doesn't appear to do anything except clog my pores. I have not had a breakout in over 10 years (I am in my 50's) and one or the other of these products did cause my face to break out.

Input:I like the texture and length of the hair, BUT, it is not easy to use.  The hair is easily tangled.  I would not recommend.
Output:negative
Input:the texture of this hair was horrible, i was unable to use this hair and it scratched my scalp. I bought 2 packs to make sure i had enough and was truly disappointed in this.  And I dont recommend this for anyone. I am not happy with it and the only place i believe is the best is the trash. I WONT BE GETTING IT AGAIN

Input:The texture of this hair is very luxurious the color is very beautiful I have not took it out the package yet cuz I need the right outfit for this this color wig I'm going to be looking for that a darker blue soon.
Output:positive
Input:After trying many different body sponges, I‚Äôve finally found the perfect one. This is just the right size, shape, and color (do all of the others really need to be pink, yellow, or blue?), and it has the perfect amount of texture to lightly exfoliate without feeling like steel wool. The only kind of weird thing is that the scrubby side starts to turn grayish black after awhile (maybe a couple of months?), but I guess that‚Äôs its way of telling me it‚Äôs time to throw it out and switch to a new one. But overall, I LOVE these things and can‚Äôt recommend them highly enough!
Output:positive
Input:I love the texture of the hair but was a little smaller than I thought
Output:positive
Input:I was very excited to try this product. It has a somewhat sticky texture when applying, and doesn't spread easily until you apply heat- I use a blow drying curling iron to smooth and shape my unruly curly hair. This paste smells delicious, and once heat is applied it spreads and coats the hair smoothly and evenly.

Input:I bought this wig with the intentions of it being my quick style for the work week. It washed very easily and had beautiful texture. The problem started after I allowed the hair to air dry. I moisture the hair with a leave in since it's a curly texture. I noticed stingy ends and the wig did not appear to be the length I purchased. At least 2 inches shorter given that the ends were not salvageable. I decided to trim the ends and flat iron and curl the hair today as an attempt to still make it work. The frontal is so short that the length is really just bangs at this point. I wish I could return it.
Output:negative
Input:Vivite Vibrance has a smooth texture and disappears into my skin instantly. One bottle lasts a very long time, too.
Output:positive
Input:Used once, lumpy texture.
Output:negative
Input:Horrible! It tangled, made me itch a day after putting it on my washed and clean hair. The texture sucks for crochet hairstyles, the locs tangle so badly not to mention the curls at the end of them. I won‚Äôt be buying or recommending this particular product. The colour is absolutely gorgeous thou
Output:negative
Input:First issue i noticed is during install this hair sheds extremely bad. Next, i got the feeling based off the texture that this hair was not 100% human, that was later confirmed when i placed some heat on it. This hair gets frizzy quickly, she‚Äôs horribly & must be a human/synthetic blend because it did not take heat well at all. I want to throw it away
Output:negative
Input:The hair is a bit rough and itchy in texture and it gets nappy really quick. On a good note, it's cute when styled right and taken care of. Definitely not suitable for a long-term hair style once applied.
Output:negative
Input:I am in love with these lashes! I have had strip lashes, and extensions, and everything in the book and these are the easiest and most comfortable of them all. Their texture is amazing and they look and feel wonderful. I‚Äôve basically told all my friends to purchase them!recommend these!

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:Like several others, I hit the ""order"" button on the free two week trial without reading the fine print. I did read it immediately thereafter however, so was aware of the automatic enrollment in Dermitage's monthly renewal subscription. I received the trial product on Tuesday, Feb. 15. I called Dermitage on Friday, Feb. 25 to let them know I was not interested in the subscription. They said, ""too late!"" My two week trial was already up and I had  been billed the previous day for the first month. Of course, I cancelled immediately and they will not have any of my business in the future. As best as I can tell this is a scam to trap people into a single purchase. I doubt they get many repeat customers.<br /><br />The cream feels refreshing on my skin, but after 10 days I cannot see any improvement to my skin tone or texture. I have very few wrinkles, just some fine lines around my eys and mouth. They look the same. The instant lifting creme doesn't appear to do anything except clog my pores. I have not had a breakout in over 10 years (I am in my 50's) and one or the other of these products did cause my face to break out.
Output:negative
Input:I like the texture and length of the hair, BUT, it is not easy to use.  The hair is easily tangled.  I would not recommend.
Output:negative
Input:the texture of this hair was horrible, i was unable to use this hair and it scratched my scalp. I bought 2 packs to make sure i had enough and was truly disappointed in this.  And I dont recommend this for anyone. I am not happy with it and the only place i believe is the best is the trash. I WONT BE GETTING IT AGAIN
Output:negative
Input:The texture of this hair is very luxurious the color is very beautiful I have not took it out the package yet cuz I need the right outfit for this this color wig I'm going to be looking for that a darker blue soon.
Output:positive
Input:After trying many different body sponges, I‚Äôve finally found the perfect one. This is just the right size, shape, and color (do all of the others really need to be pink, yellow, or blue?), and it has the perfect amount of texture to lightly exfoliate without feeling like steel wool. The only kind of weird thing is that the scrubby side starts to turn grayish black after awhile (maybe a couple of months?), but I guess that‚Äôs its way of telling me it‚Äôs time to throw it out and switch to a new one. But overall, I LOVE these things and can‚Äôt recommend them highly enough!
Output:positive
Input:I love the texture of the hair but was a little smaller than I thought
Output:positive
Input:I was very excited to try this product. It has a somewhat sticky texture when applying, and doesn't spread easily until you apply heat- I use a blow drying curling iron to smooth and shape my unruly curly hair. This paste smells delicious, and once heat is applied it spreads and coats the hair smoothly and evenly. It's not heavy or greasy and helps hold my hair in the curls and shapes I create for several hours.

ƒ†made,ƒ†amount,"Input:I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great! Each drawer comes with a liner to keep things nice and neat.<br /><br />*I received my acrylic organizer from Marrywindix for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.

Input:I purchased the Travolle hanging toiletry bag for when my husband travels on business.  Right away, we were impressed with the great quality of the water-resistant canvas material that the travel organizer is made of.  It‚Äôs a lightweight bag that collapses easily.  With as compact as it comes, it was surprising to see exactly how spacious this hanging travel organizer really was.<br /><br />It has a total of 17 compartments, including four separate compartments equipped with sturdy zippers, and mesh & nylon open compartments to keep toiletries upright.  There‚Äôs a strong hook attached which makes this travel organizer very accessible and convenient when constantly on the go.  After several trips, I‚Äôm glad to say that this bag made my husband‚Äôs business trips much easier.  Nothing spilled and nothing was left behind.  I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this travel organizer to those that travel often.

Input:I was AMAZED at how great of a deal @Beautycreations gives when you purchase this set.  First off you get two eyeshadow palettes and a bananna setting powder for a descent price most of the time when that happens you end up with eyeshadows that aint worth a darn but not with this set the eyeshadows are VERY VIBRANT and dont forget you get two for what you would be paying for one. This particular set has lots of colors that can be mixed and matched with lots of different looks so no matter what you wear that day you have a eyeshadow that will match with any and every outfit. The colors in both palettes vary from matte to shimmery so which ever look your going for you got a eyeshadow to go with it. These eyeshadows are very blendable and not patchy at all. I am very IMPRESSED WITH BEAUTY CREATIONS EYESHADOW PALETTES these particular palettes definetly fall into some of my favorites thats for sure and thats considering I have plenty. I highley reccommend this eyeshadow palette set I havent tried the bananna setting powder yet but either way the way I look at it for what i paid for this set I could dislike the powder and this set would have still been worth it for the price but if the setting powders quality is anything like  the eyeshadow palettes im sure ill love it but anyway I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THESE!!!<br /><br />**UPDATE** This bananna powder might just be my favorite no joke it leaves such a glamourous look on your face. It doesnt leave any streaks on your face or make your face look cakey if another it prevents your face from looking cakey if you have a foundation that happens to be cakey. The eyeshadows are still amazing everyday I use them I mean theres just so many colors to choose from and only 7 days a week lol but for real the endless patterns and combination of colors you can use just amazes me. So my opnion is still to choose these ones!!!

Input:I really wanted to like these travel bottles, but they‚Äôre absolutely terrible to use. The lids are definitely not secure because you can‚Äôt twist them on. You just pop them over the silicone bottle.  They‚Äôre also difficult to clean out so you can reuse them, which is the whole point.  It‚Äôs also hard to use all of the product in the bottle because when you squeeze the silicone bottle, the product will just come out the side of the lid instead of the top.  I definitely regret this purchase and wish I wasn‚Äôt outside of the return window.

Input:[[VIDEOID:3c4d30d8ebacec043d1033906e909174]] I was really excited and happy to buy this Beauty Bon 12 Piece Mani/Pedi set as I've been wanting a set exactly like this one for a long while! Please watch the video as it is absolutely necessary you SEE this 12 piece Beauty Bon Mani/Pedi set on video! I've done a lot of product review videos and this is probably the most important one I've done. If you are looking of a review where someone shares what they wished they would've known BEFORE they bought a really neat looking product, then you must watch this video review and read the written review!<br /><br />I have wanted a mani/pedi set like this that I could pop in my purse because it seems I'm always breaking a nail and don't ever know exactly where my clippers/nail files are. I wouldn't be embarrassed to have this one in my purse, but as you see on the video there were some problems with the case which was the first warning sign that this set might not be all I would want it to be. I'm not a fan of the look of the case or that it has some noticeable problems. **The description says at the top that the box can be opened by the press of a button which is exactly how it works. But then the description contradicts itself and says the kit has a zipper closure. Untrue. If you look at other reviewers' photos in addition to the product photo, this case does NOT have a zipper. Warning flag.<br /><br />As I show you in the video, these mani/pedi pieces are not only poor quality, more than one piece broke upon using it only once. I was so excited to have and use this set and equally disappointed when the set turned out to be so poor in quality. There is one item that I liked and will use: the biggest clipper- though the quality is still sub par.  The smaller clipper broke after I clipped a few of my tiny toe nails. The third small clipper with an angled edge didn't work at all. The difference between these clippers and others I've owned is that they don't have resistance and therefore cannot cut the nail.<br /><br />I show you how neither the nipper nor the scissors would cut through my skin. Useless! The nail file is so tiny that it is intended more for if you break a nail and need a nail file in a pinch to smooth a nail on the spot-not as a full mani/pedi set! The tweezers don't work as they can't grab anything. There are several tiny tools which I have used in the past to help with the in-grown toenails I have on my big toes or to clean out under my nails. But the last few are a mystery not only to me but most reviewers who commented on them as I think most were stumped. Some of the mystery pieces looked like what would be in my blemish remover kit. The description starts to list the pieces in this 12 piece set yet doesn't list them all. There is no information about the set and it could use a sheet included that lists he tools and describes what they are used for as obviously we customers don't know and would like to.<br /><br />To put it mildly, I was disappointed that the cuticle nipper that is shown in the product photograph is NOT the nipper that comes with this set. I looked at all the reviewer photographs of their set up to date of this review it seems they also did not get the nipper that is in the photo either. I know the difference because I own a nipper that looks like the one in the photograph and it is much different than the one that came with my set. To add insult to injury- the one that came with my set is not working and broken as you can see in the video. I feel it is defrauding a customer to advertise a product in a photograph representing what the buyer will receive and then do not send exactly what is shown to the customer. And if they do change the product, they should alert the customer before shipping and give them an option to opt out. Look closely and you see tha the nipper in the photo has an extra metal piece on the right handle, but what we as customers have received looks nothing like that. The following product shows what the nipper in the photograph looks like; I expected something similar: [[ASIN:B017N5DMHM Podiatrist's Toenail Clippers for Thick and Ingrown Nails -- Surgical Grade Stainless Steel]].<br /><br />My one star review is fair. The majority of the pieces in my set don't work. None of the pieces are the quality I would expect at this price level as I expect items to work when I buy them.  I think that is a fair expectation.. There is one clipper that works, but the quality is relative to the rest. I don't feel the case is sturdy enough to last very long as it already has issues. For these and the other reasons you can see in the video and written reviews I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />This product was bought at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. If you have any questions or comments, please post them as I'd love to discuss. I hope I've been helpful in your decision making about this purchase.
Output:negative
Input:Nailbeds are too deep and thin, making it unrealistic to practice with. Acrylic application ends up being way to thick to make level with the nail and then if applied correctly, looks retarded when taking pictures because your work and designs are like 2cm below the mannequin's cuticle.
Output:negative
Input:The glue would not hold the nail . They came off within a few hours
Output:negative
Input:These looked great on until 2 days in the polish is chipping off the nail. Not Barnsley an issue as an avid press on fan
Output:negative
Input:My nail polish doesn‚Äôt change colors at all!! One doesn‚Äôt even show up color on my nails, I applied 3 layers and nothing!!
Output:negative
Input:Since we can't go to the nail salon, I've gotten items to do my own nails.  I've started using acrylic nails and these emery boards are perfect for shaping the nails.  It is also great on my natural nails and are the perfect size and shape to shape my nails as well as my acrylic nails.
Output:positive
Input:First off, the drill looks great. The drill is lightweight yet durable. It comes with a belt/pocket clip on, long cord, several attachments, and charges pretty quickly. It‚Äôs has variable speeds that you control with the ease of a knob on the top of. Attachment bits are very easy to change. I absolutely recommend this nail drill!!!
Output:positive
Input:Fun concept.  Sometimes it works great and then the next nail doesn't work as all.  Not sure why, but probably the magnet has to be held at the EXACT correct position which is hard to do and not touch the nail.  Still lots of fun especially when it works well.  Very pretty colors.

I know the difference because I own a nipper that looks like the one in the photograph and it is much different than the one that came with my set. To add insult to injury- the one that came with my set is not working and broken as you can see in the video. I feel it is defrauding a customer to advertise a product in a photograph representing what the buyer will receive and then do not send exactly what is shown to the customer. And if they do change the product, they should alert the customer before shipping and give them an option to opt out. Look closely and you see tha the nipper in the photo has an extra metal piece on the right handle, but what we as customers have received looks nothing like that. The following product shows what the nipper in the photograph looks like; I expected something similar: [[ASIN:B017N5DMHM Podiatrist's Toenail Clippers for Thick and Ingrown Nails -- Surgical Grade Stainless Steel]].<br /><br />My one star review is fair. The majority of the pieces in my set don't work. None of the pieces are the quality I would expect at this price level as I expect items to work when I buy them.  I think that is a fair expectation.. There is one clipper that works, but the quality is relative to the rest. I don't feel the case is sturdy enough to last very long as it already has issues. For these and the other reasons you can see in the video and written reviews I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />This product was bought at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. If you have any questions or comments, please post them as I'd love to discuss. I hope I've been helpful in your decision making about this purchase.
Output:negative
Input:Nailbeds are too deep and thin, making it unrealistic to practice with. Acrylic application ends up being way to thick to make level with the nail and then if applied correctly, looks retarded when taking pictures because your work and designs are like 2cm below the mannequin's cuticle.
Output:negative
Input:The glue would not hold the nail. They came off within a few hours
Output:negative
Input:These looked great on until 2 days in the polish is chipping off the nail. Not Barnsley an issue as an avid press on fan
Output:negative
Input:My nail polish doesn‚Äôt change colors at all!! One doesn‚Äôt even show up color on my nails, I applied 3 layers and nothing!!
Output:negative
Input:Since we can't go to the nail salon, I've gotten items to do my own nails.  I've started using acrylic nails and these emery boards are perfect for shaping the nails.  It is also great on my natural nails and are the perfect size and shape to shape my nails as well as my acrylic nails.
Output:positive
Input:First off, the drill looks great. The drill is lightweight yet durable. It comes with a belt/pocket clip on, long cord, several attachments, and charges pretty quickly. It‚Äôs has variable speeds that you control with the ease of a knob on the top of. Attachment bits are very easy to change. I absolutely recommend this nail drill!!!
Output:positive
Input:Fun concept.  Sometimes it works great and then the next nail doesn't work as all.  Not sure why, but probably the magnet has to be held at the EXACT correct position which is hard to do and not touch the nail.  Still lots of fun especially when it works well.  Very pretty colors.
