Ġgre,Ġproblem,"Input:This is the best moisturizer cream I've ever used.  I immediately felt my skin loving the moisture.  I tend toward dry skin and this wonderful mixture was so good for my face.  I also have used it directly to areas that seem to be drier and the response is with a day or two.  My driest spots have virtually disappeared in ten days.  Each time I used it (twice per day), it didn't leave any kind of a greasy feel on the face; it was absorbed immediately.  It doesn't have any fragrance and it allows my face to feel lighter than it did with other products of a similar nature.  You know all the ingredients or you wouldn't be here. but the blend and the application are superior.<br /><br />I purchased this item with a coupon I received as part of a review.  This should not minimize the quality of this product.
Output:positive
Input:Love, love, love this dry shampoo! My hair is dark brown and this shampoo is not visible. It dissolves well in my hair. The aroma is really nice but don’t expect it to last in your hair. I have very greasy hair and the shampoo soaked up the grease well.
Output:positive
Input:Absorbs quickly and thoroughly. Never feels greasy and really clears up dry skin. Even cleared up my eczema!
Output:positive
Input:This stuff is anything but weightless. It left my hair greasy and weighed down. It also doesn’t smell very good. I ended up throwing it away after a couple of uses.
Output:negative
Input:I liked the assortment of colors however they are too soft and go on too greasy. I haven’t used any of them except for one
Output:negative
Input:I love this wax stick! It lays my hair down perfectly! It’s not too greasy yet still provides the weight needed for a nice look! It smells so yummy too! This is my go to brand for everything hair related. All of their products are 5 stars!
Output:positive
Input:Just makes hair greasy and sticky looking. Color barely shows up even on blonde hair except for the blue. Very disappointing!
Output:negative
Input:I’ve been using these lotions on my face and hands and they leave my skin so soft. It has a pleasant smell not too strong and a little goes along way. I love that it’s thick but not too greasy. It absorbs good into my skin. I use it as part of my daily face routine and I can definitely see the difference.
Output:positive
Input:I have been using this serum for a few days and I am very happy with it.  It is very light and absorbs almost instantly - not greasy or heavy at all and there is virtually no waiting time for the product to dry or sink in so that you can get on with your routine.  There is a light pleasant scent but you have to really try to smell it and even that disappears rapidly.  I will continue to use this daily because it is quick and easy and I have already seen a reduction in redness and an over all improvement in the texture of my skin.  I have pretty sensitive skin too, and for me there was no tingling or stinging at all.
Output:positive
Input:Would have liked saving on the 6 pack but after 2 months had to cancel the order and order a smaller quantity at double the price. My brother loves the product but it is no longer sold in stores he frequents. He says it hold his hair in place and is not greasy.
Output:negative
Input:One of the better eye creams I’ve tried! It keeps my puffiness at bay and leaves no residue. There’s not really a scent to it, it’s not greasy or heavy but my skin absorbs it very well and it keeps me super moisturized throughout the day/night (been applying both mornings and evenings). Time will tell whether it will work on my developing wrinkles but I’m really happy with it so far.
Output:positive
Input:Like previous person said, it's &#34;laughably small&#34;. It does not do a good job of holding the hair. It's lasts for about an hour then the hair looks super greasy. Not impressed!
Output:negative
Input:I'm a bit of a lipbalm junkie, and let me tell you, this stuff is the bees' knees. Not a single unnatural ingredient, nor a synthetic nor toxic chemical insight. It tastes great! It really does taste like vanilla and chai with a hint of sweetness, but not too much; just enough. It has a silky finish, and it stays on your lips without a heavy or greasy feel.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have, and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars, is because the packaging is cheap. The part you rotate to raise the balm itself doesn't work, so you basically have to dig down into the tube to get at the contents, unless you're lucky enough that yours works.
Output:positive
Input:This collagen cream is great on skin. I love how it leaves my face feeling so soft and hydrated without feeling greasy or oily. Will be ordering more!!
Output:positive
Input:Originally, I purchased 2 smaller 15ml bottle and loved the product. It was a thick product that didn't feel oily at all and felt amazing and silky on my skin. It provided a smooth matte slate and filled in fine lines. It also makes the application of my makeup easy and smooth. So, I thought I would buy two of the larger bottles considering I liked it so much. However, these two larger bottles are much more liquid like and watery. It makes my skin feel more greasy. However, since then, a company representative reached out to me about my concerns and has truly impressed me with their awesome customer service and willingness to accommodate my concerns. I was refunded the TOTAL amount from my purchase and was sent a new bottle at no charge. The new bottle is just as great as the very first one  that I ordered. I made sure to give my positive feedback to the supplier and they are now sending me another bottle as compensation for my original order that wasn't right. With that being said, I am an extremely satisfied customer, as not too many companies would go out of their way to make this right. They also included a bottle of their BB cream for me to try, in which I instantly fell in love with. I have used many primers in my time and have never found one that fills in my fine lines like this product does. I highly recommend their products and will continue to be a loyal customer.

Ġcomes,Ġliquid,"Input:The price is great for this toothbrush, especially comparing it to the rest of electric toothbrushes out there. With this great price comes some design flaws. The Vitality is shaped differently than the AdvancePower (which my wife is using now and is happy with). The AdvancePower is shaped with the wide part at the base, whereas the Vitality is wide at the top and tapers down at the bottom. While it might not seem like a big deal, the result is that your toothpasty saliva very easily drips down the body of the toothbrush and onto your fingers and hand. Even when I'm careful, on most days my toothpasty saliva gets all over my hands, and it is the most annoying thing in the world. So unless you raise your elbow up to the sky every single time (which is not terribly comfortable), expect your hands to get dirty. Also as a result of the tapered shape, the toothbrush falls over easily, causing the head (that you stick in your mouth!) to get dirty. This toothbrush is as annoying as ever... but it does run well, and I can't complain too much because I didn't pay that much for it.
Output:negative
Input:I've tried out a few of the Wet Cherry/Lime Crime glosses recently. Besides the green I was most looking forward to this one, but I have to say, I'm sadly disappointed.<br /><br />The color is -almost- spot on to how it's shown, but it's a little more red than the orange-gold color, and to even get it close to the color presented, you have to -really- cake it on your lips, otherwise it comes off much, much lighter. Which might not be unreasonable, except I noticed this particular tube I got had a huge empty spot in the middle. So I gotta cake it on to get the desired color and this big tube only came about a third to maybe a half full? That feels more than a little unfair for the price, gotta say.  I'd come back for a couple of the colors I've tried from them but this probably wouldn't be one...
Output:negative
Input:I wanted to like this because i love the idea of messy art projects contained to the bath and like that the paint is actually soap, so it comes off easily.  Below are my problems:<br /><br />1) While it is a variety of colors, I got two robins egg blue, a red, and a green.  Wish I would have received 4 colors instead of 3.<br />2) The paint is very running and comes out really fast.  If it were thicker, it would be easier to paint with.<br />3) The paint is actually very sheer so you need a lot of it to show up on the bath walls.
Output:negative
Input:I agree with other reviewers here about them being too tight.  I am a man with an average-to-small head and these are too tight.  I was excited to see something that wasn't too &#34;girly&#34; that I could wear since I am growing my hair out and this keeps the hair out of my eyes and helps on my many &#34;awkward&#34; days that comes with growing hair out until it is long enough for a ponytail.  It's too bad because the material feels nice and I like the versatility of being able to have a narrow or wide headband.  However, unless you feel you have an abnormally small head, I would stay away from these until they are re-engineered to not be so tight or maybe add an adjustability option.  The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I can wear them for a short period of time before having to take them off because it hurts/pinches too much.
Output:negative
Input:A really great selection of barrettes and comes with a bag as well. There are so many here, very good price for this assortment.
Output:positive
Input:This hair was a waste if my 44.00 shedding comes a loose
Output:negative
Input:This tongue scraper only requires one hand to use & comes in a carrying case.
Output:positive
Input:I was so excited to receive ny lashes. Honeyy they are nice, long and bold. However the liquid liner that comes with it is horrible, it dosent hold very well, you have to use atleast two coats and bc of that your eyelids might have a stain to it. Case is cute though
Output:negative
Input:I really thought I'd be able to pluck small hairs with these tweezers (since the package came with 3 different styles and sizes) and I CANNOT.  The edges of the tweezers don't seem to press together properly so you cannot get a good grasp on the hair.  If you do manage to find a spot where you can actually clamp the hair and you start to pull, the hair break off (or is cut off) at the skin level and you are left with the perfect beginning to an ingrown hair.  The finepoint tweezers are the worst of the bunch, they virtually do nothing.  I've tried over and over again for months to get used to these tweezers and I'm still having the same issues.  The only nice thing about this set is the case it comes with.<br /> Hope you all have better luck.
Output:negative
Input:Like their other products, comes in a nice little box filled with shredded crinkled paper, which makes the whole thing recyclable, and protects the bottle nicely.  The pump bottle works well, even though the product was a little more watery than I anticipated.  Feels nice and smooth, and dries quickly.  Has not caused breakouts or excessive dryness, although I have not seen results yet.  Will update review in a few weeks
Output:positive
Input:When they hold together, they work really well.  It sure beats soaking your fingers in acetone.  The problem I found is that the pin that holds the two pieces together comes out very easily.  I used them once and I'm down to 6 working clips.  I am disappointed by the cheapness of these!
Output:negative
Input:I bought this in a scramble when we were suddenly invited to visit a friend with a pool and my usual aesthetician had just closed shop.. I hate to shave my bikini area -- ingrown hairs always result -- so I tried this as a last resort. To my surprise and pleasure, the wax works great! Just as good as having a pro do it. And no mess -- you just warm the strip in your hand, place the strip on the area to wax, and pull. I felt no pain (I've been told I have a high pain tolerance, but usually I do at least feel a pinch when getting waxed, but not with these). I will be using these from now on and saving the trip and money of going to a pro.<br /><br />The box comes with a few wet wipes to catch any wax left on your skin but I didn't need to use it.
Output:positive
Input:Just got mine today. Also got one for my sister. We love it. Spraying it everywhere. Want to buy more. Love love love. Great spray control. Very useful. For hair, watering plants and if you wanted to use it for your cleaning products. Love how it comes out misty but very moist.
Output:positive
Input:This nail polish is definitely high quality and comes in a wide variety of colors and textures. Most of them only need one coat to cover the nail bed and the set comes with a clear top coat that is red tinted. So far I have been using them for about a week and the nail polish hasn't gotten gloppy and so far hasn't chipped or cracked. It leaves a very pleasant smooth matte finish when applied to the nail which I think is more than worth the money. I would certainly buy this again.
Output:positive
Input:Love that you can refill these very easily and it comes with clip

ĠAlso,Ġat,"Input:First of all let me start by saying I actually purchased this item and it was not given to me for review by any special programs.<br /><br />Let's start with the product quality: I could not have asked for a more quality item. It functions well, has a sleek and attractive design, charges quickly, and is of excellent quality. The only neutral comment I have is that it turns on just a little bit too easily. There are safety tabs that surround the button, and it's a twist action to turn it on, but I have no doubt that my children could easily turn this on. I have made sure to keep the brush head attached instead of the epilator, and keep it out of reach of the children. Also worth mentioning is the useful little light that helps you see a little bit better.<br /><br />I will start by saying this, epilating will not be for everyone. My assess my pain tolerance at a mid-level, not especially high, but definitely not low, and I will say the first use was moderately painful.<br /><br />I have tried this on underarms, and legs at this point and have used it twice in the 3 or so weeks I have had it. The second use was remarkably easier, and I breezed right through.<br /><br />Now for those of you unfamiliar with epilating, this process can be painful but will definitely last longer than shaving, and for that I was willing to try it. I had previously tried the facial epilator made by Braun that I like, and so I knew a little bit of what to expect. Even knowing what to expect did not prepare me for my first attempt. If you have ever gotten a tattoo on your leg, I would liken the pain of epilating to the sensation that you feel after you've been having the lines drawn for about 20 minutes. It has moments of sharp pain, but for the most part it is just a constant scratchy prickling sensation. For the underarms, the pain is worse. Start with small sections and make sure to stretch the skin as best as possible. It took me a good 45 minutes the first time through (the battery was a champ, and showed no signs of weakness after this). I was happy with the results, and it lasted about 8-10 days before I felt the need to give it another go. My second time I breezed right through and finished it in about 20 minutes with much less pain and irritation.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I recommend this product for anyone who is tired of daily or every other day shaving and wants an easy at home alternative that lasts. If you are willing to have a bit of pain for the gain, then go for this all the way. You will get used to the pain and will thank yourself for the saved time.

Input:I just received this item and it is horrible despite all the good reviews! Battery lasted literally 5 minutes. I plugged it in to charge thinking I can continue while it's plugged in, but NO! It won't even work while it's charging. You have to completely charge it in order to use it and when it is charged, it only last 5 mins at a time. So annoying! Also, it comes with a cable that is about the same length as a tv remote control. It's hard to reach anything with such short cable. I had a spare phone charger so I used that to charge instead. I will be returning this ASAP!

Input:This is a nice kit that contains several good-to-have items for a plane flight sitting in close quarters. Included are decent antibacterial wipes, very soft tissues, and ear plugs. Also included are an eye mask, pillowcase, and a resealable quart bag that is more durable than a zip lock bag. This is a quite useful kit to pack with you for a plane trip.

Input:I followed the instructions in its entirety to avoid damaging the product. During my first use of the Yebeauty cap I noticed it was leaking a gel like substance and from there it never stopped. Also, I was expecting the cap to hold the heat for at least 30 mins but nope...not so efficient.Poor poor value for money

Input:I first became acquainted with Sauce brand products when my wife worked at Sally beauty supply and brought this home. It works wonders on my beard and my wife loves using it too. The smell is nice without being too overpowering and leaves hair and beards feeling really nice. Also, it's awesome that Amazon carries this and that it's cheaper than buying it at Sallys.

Input:This is better than physical therapy! My wrist feels great every time I wear it. Also it looks very trendy and it does not scratch.
Output:positive
Input:I saw the advertisement and I decided to check this out.  Didn't realize how quite expensive it was, but I decided to take a chance and boy am I am glad.  Totally worth the purchase price.  My teeth feels cleaner, look brighter and my mouth seems fresher.  I even smile more after the use of this product and I am one to never smile.  It feels as if you are getting a professional cleaning everytime you use it.  Not only does this thing brushes your teeth, it polishes them also.  I am actually going to purchase another one so I can have one at home and one at work.  Also, for famillies, all you have to do is buy more heads because everyone can use this.  And this thing is totally pain free, in fact it tickles your mouth, but you will most certainly look forward to brushing.  The three speeds are very nice, plus if you follow the directions and brush in quarters, it has a bit of a hesitation to let you know when to move onto the next quarter.  I find this very useful if you never had proper instructions on brushing.  This is, in my opinion a life changing and habit changing product.

Input:I received a box of 6 nail polish bottles. One was broken and ruined the other 5 bottles of polish and cut up my hands. I wasn’t able to use any of them. I love sally Hanson gel polish but this was so disappointing. Also I got 3 of the same color and three others that were bright blue, gray and red (the broken one). If all six bottles weren’t ruined, I still didn’t get a fair order.  I’d like a refund

Input:The only thing important on this product is the active ingredient chlorexidine. The standard concentration is 2%. Hibiclens is an &#34;overkill&#34; at 4%. Regardless, here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES on this chemical agent.<br />.<br />.<br />ADVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser - the &#34;gold standard&#34; in the opinion of numerous medical people. According to all available literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens and disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane wall, thus destroying the organism. Because human and animal tissues are also negatively charge, the agent binds to the skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth.<br />. . . The antiseptic properties only affect organisms on the skin. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY's &#34;Penetration of Chlorhexidine into Human Skin&#34; reported &#34;poor penetration of chlorhexidine into skin following 2 min. and 30 min. exposures to chlorhexidine was observed.&#34; In other words, the agent is relatively safe because it does not penetrate the skin and get absorbed into human tissue or the blood stream and cause damage or toxic chemical reactions.<br />.<br />2. Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%.<br />.<br />In most hospitals, physicians scrub their hands with this agent before surgery. Also, patients must wash with this agent on the evening and morning before their operations.<br />.<br />3. A 2% solution is the recommended concentration to be used for surgical scrubbing according to EPIC and CDC guidelines. This maybe an overkill for consumer usage. As a skin cleanser, THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS NURSING reported that anything over a 0.5% concentration showed &#34;no significant differences statistically, including persistent effects within 24 hours.&#34; A lower strength of 0.2% was just as effective according to INT. ENDED J. 2001. The only difference is speed. A 0.2% concentration takes 1 min. to completely kill E. Faccalis while a 2% concentration takes 30 sec.<br />. . . The ineffective limit is a 0.12% concentration. This does not kill E. Faccalis. The above findings were replicated and confirmed by a more recent U.S. study in J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb.<br />. . . For oral rinsing, it is a different matter because the mouth is not covered by skin but mucus membrane. It is also host to different germs. The standard treatment is a 0.12% chlorhexidine concentration. However, optimum effects require a higher concentration. Clinical trials reported by THE JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY said that a 1% concentration &#34;showed a significant reduction through intensive treatment (3-4 daily applications over 2 days) or through daily application for 10 and 14 days.&#34;<br />.<br />4. Because a 0.2% concentration is just as effective as &#34;straight out of the bottle,&#34; a 2% chlorhexidine can be diluted with water to yield ten times the amount of usable disinfectant. Also, a 4% Hibiclens concentration can yield 20 times the amount.<br />.<br />5. Hibiclens is overpriced. The cheapest on amazon.com is $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive. . . . It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of the stuff.<br />.<br />A cheaper alternative is to buy a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate from a pet products vendor. The cheapest is sold by Greener Pastures Veterinary Service Store for $8.25/gallon. If the user purchases $100+, there is free 2-day shipping.<br />.<br />6. Among most chlorhexidine literature from manufacturers, they recommend one to two ounces to a gallon of cleaning solution for sanitizing floors, counter-tops, and furniture. In addition, anecdotal testimonies from pet owners, stores, and clinics report a reduction in sicknesses among animals when the solution is used to clean their cages, skin, and gums.<br />. . . This is surprising. One ounce of chlorhexidine to a gallon of water amounts to a 0.03125% solution. According to a study by the J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb., E. Faccalis bacteria was smeared on glass cones. A 0.12% chlorhexidine concentrate failed to kill the strain. It required a 0.2% or higher to do the job.<br />. . . Based on these facts, the only possible conclusion is that the weaker concentration does not directly kill existing bacteria but creates a hostile environment for germ growth. The chemical inhibits the spread of dangerous organisms on the skin, mouth, and inorganic surfaces. Through time, the noxious population is further reduced. Thus, it becomes less dangerous to the host.<br />.<br />7. J. ACQUIR. IMMUNE. DEFIC. SYNDR. 2004 Feb. 1 reported that a 0.25% concentration is well tolerated by women, even in the sensitive vaginal area. At 1% concentration, there were 13% complaints of burning and itching.<br />.<br />.<br />DISAVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The product has risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes ulceration damages.<br />.<br />2. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction: irritation and redness.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:First of all let me start by saying I actually purchased this item and it was not given to me for review by any special programs.<br /><br />Let's start with the product quality: I could not have asked for a more quality item. It functions well, has a sleek and attractive design, charges quickly, and is of excellent quality. The only neutral comment I have is that it turns on just a little bit too easily. There are safety tabs that surround the button, and it's a twist action to turn it on, but I have no doubt that my children could easily turn this on. I have made sure to keep the brush head attached instead of the epilator, and keep it out of reach of the children. Also worth mentioning is the useful little light that helps you see a little bit better.<br /><br />I will start by saying this, epilating will not be for everyone. My assess my pain tolerance at a mid-level, not especially high, but definitely not low, and I will say the first use was moderately painful.<br /><br />I have tried this on underarms, and legs at this point and have used it twice in the 3 or so weeks I have had it. The second use was remarkably easier, and I breezed right through.<br /><br />Now for those of you unfamiliar with epilating, this process can be painful but will definitely last longer than shaving, and for that I was willing to try it. I had previously tried the facial epilator made by Braun that I like, and so I knew a little bit of what to expect. Even knowing what to expect did not prepare me for my first attempt. If you have ever gotten a tattoo on your leg, I would liken the pain of epilating to the sensation that you feel after you've been having the lines drawn for about 20 minutes. It has moments of sharp pain, but for the most part it is just a constant scratchy prickling sensation. For the underarms, the pain is worse. Start with small sections and make sure to stretch the skin as best as possible. It took me a good 45 minutes the first time through (the battery was a champ, and showed no signs of weakness after this). I was happy with the results, and it lasted about 8-10 days before I felt the need to give it another go. My second time I breezed right through and finished it in about 20 minutes with much less pain and irritation.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I recommend this product for anyone who is tired of daily or every other day shaving and wants an easy at home alternative that lasts. If you are willing to have a bit of pain for the gain, then go for this all the way. You will get used to the pain and will thank yourself for the saved time.

Input:I just received this item and it is horrible despite all the good reviews! Battery lasted literally 5 minutes. I plugged it in to charge thinking I can continue while it's plugged in, but NO! It won't even work while it's charging. You have to completely charge it in order to use it and when it is charged, it only last 5 mins at a time. So annoying! Also, it comes with a cable that is about the same length as a tv remote control. It's hard to reach anything with such short cable. I had a spare phone charger so I used that to charge instead. I will be returning this ASAP!

Input:This is a nice kit that contains several good-to-have items for a plane flight sitting in close quarters. Included are decent antibacterial wipes, very soft tissues, and ear plugs. Also included are an eye mask, pillowcase, and a resealable quart bag that is more durable than a zip lock bag. This is a quite useful kit to pack with you for a plane trip.

Input:I followed the instructions in its entirety to avoid damaging the product. During my first use of the Yebeauty cap I noticed it was leaking a gel like substance and from there it never stopped. Also, I was expecting the cap to hold the heat for at least 30 mins but nope...not so efficient.Poor poor value for money

Input:I first became acquainted with Sauce brand products when my wife worked at Sally beauty supply and brought this home. It works wonders on my beard and my wife loves using it too. The smell is nice without being too overpowering and leaves hair and beards feeling really nice. Also, it's awesome that Amazon carries this and that it's cheaper than buying it at Sallys.

Input:I saw the advertisement and I decided to check this out.  Didn't realize how quite expensive it was, but I decided to take a chance and boy am I am glad.  Totally worth the purchase price.  My teeth feels cleaner, look brighter and my mouth seems fresher.  I even smile more after the use of this product and I am one to never smile.  It feels as if you are getting a professional cleaning everytime you use it.  Not only does this thing brushes your teeth, it polishes them also.  I am actually going to purchase another one so I can have one at home and one at work.  Also, for famillies, all you have to do is buy more heads because everyone can use this.  And this thing is totally pain free, in fact it tickles your mouth, but you will most certainly look forward to brushing.  The three speeds are very nice, plus if you follow the directions and brush in quarters, it has a bit of a hesitation to let you know when to move onto the next quarter.  I find this very useful if you never had proper instructions on brushing.  This is, in my opinion a life changing and habit changing product.

Input:I received a box of 6 nail polish bottles. One was broken and ruined the other 5 bottles of polish and cut up my hands. I wasn’t able to use any of them. I love sally Hanson gel polish but this was so disappointing. Also I got 3 of the same color and three others that were bright blue, gray and red (the broken one). If all six bottles weren’t ruined, I still didn’t get a fair order.  I’d like a refund

Input:The only thing important on this product is the active ingredient chlorexidine. The standard concentration is 2%. Hibiclens is an &#34;overkill&#34; at 4%. Regardless, here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES on this chemical agent.<br />.<br />.<br />ADVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser - the &#34;gold standard&#34; in the opinion of numerous medical people. According to all available literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens and disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane wall, thus destroying the organism. Because human and animal tissues are also negatively charge, the agent binds to the skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth.<br />... The antiseptic properties only affect organisms on the skin. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY's &#34;Penetration of Chlorhexidine into Human Skin&#34; reported &#34;poor penetration of chlorhexidine into skin following 2 min. and 30 min. exposures to chlorhexidine was observed.&#34; In other words, the agent is relatively safe because it does not penetrate the skin and get absorbed into human tissue or the blood stream and cause damage or toxic chemical reactions.<br />.<br />2. Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%.<br />.<br />In most hospitals, physicians scrub their hands with this agent before surgery. Also, patients must wash with this agent on the evening and morning before their operations.<br />.<br />3. A 2% solution is the recommended concentration to be used for surgical scrubbing according to EPIC and CDC guidelines. This maybe an overkill for consumer usage. As a skin cleanser, THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS NURSING reported that anything over a 0.5% concentration showed &#34;no significant differences statistically, including persistent effects within 24 hours.&#34; A lower strength of 0.2% was just as effective according to INT. ENDED J. 2001. The only difference is speed. A 0.2% concentration takes 1 min. to completely kill E. Faccalis while a 2% concentration takes 30 sec.<br />... The ineffective limit is a 0.12% concentration. This does not kill E. Faccalis. The above findings were replicated and confirmed by a more recent U.S. study in J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb.<br />... For oral rinsing, it is a different matter because the mouth is not covered by skin but mucus membrane. It is also host to different germs. The standard treatment is a 0.12% chlorhexidine concentration. However, optimum effects require a higher concentration. Clinical trials reported by THE JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY said that a 1% concentration &#34;showed a significant reduction through intensive treatment (3-4 daily applications over 2 days) or through daily application for 10 and 14 days.&#34;<br />.<br />4. Because a 0.2% concentration is just as effective as &#34;straight out of the bottle,&#34; a 2% chlorhexidine can be diluted with water to yield ten times the amount of usable disinfectant. Also, a 4% Hibiclens concentration can yield 20 times the amount.<br />.<br />5. Hibiclens is overpriced. The cheapest on amazon.com is $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive.... It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of the stuff.<br />.<br />A cheaper alternative is to buy a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate from a pet products vendor. The cheapest is sold by Greener Pastures Veterinary Service Store for $8.25/gallon. If the user purchases $100+, there is free 2-day shipping.<br />.<br />6. Among most chlorhexidine literature from manufacturers, they recommend one to two ounces to a gallon of cleaning solution for sanitizing floors, counter-tops, and furniture. In addition, anecdotal testimonies from pet owners, stores, and clinics report a reduction in sicknesses among animals when the solution is used to clean their cages, skin, and gums.<br />... This is surprising. One ounce of chlorhexidine to a gallon of water amounts to a 0.03125% solution. According to a study by the J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb., E. Faccalis bacteria was smeared on glass cones. A 0.12% chlorhexidine concentrate failed to kill the strain. It required a 0.2% or higher to do the job.<br />... Based on these facts, the only possible conclusion is that the weaker concentration does not directly kill existing bacteria but creates a hostile environment for germ growth. The chemical inhibits the spread of dangerous organisms on the skin, mouth, and inorganic surfaces. Through time, the noxious population is further reduced. Thus, it becomes less dangerous to the host.<br />.<br />7. J. ACQUIR. IMMUNE. DEFIC. SYNDR. 2004 Feb. 1 reported that a 0.25% concentration is well tolerated by women, even in the sensitive vaginal area. At 1% concentration, there were 13% complaints of burning and itching.<br />.<br />.<br />DISAVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The product has risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes ulceration damages.<br />.<br />2. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction: irritation and redness. Washing the affected area with soap and water will negate the problems within 72 hours.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.<br />.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS<br />.<br />Based on two medical studies, a water dilution of chlorhexidine to a 0.2% concentration is the minimum for eliminating microbial organisms. Leave it on for a 1 minute. As an added bonus, the 0.2% concentration is well tolerated, even in the vaginal area of females.... If you want a quick guaranteed kill, use a 0.5% concentration.<br />.<br />For inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria on counter-tops, floors, pet cages, and animals, one-to-two ounces of 2% chlorhexidine to a gallon of water &#34;will do the job.&#34; Again, this only reduces the germ population by restrict

Ġtell,Ġkeep,"Input:Many other similar kits said that they wouldn't work on my particular model of Yamaha.  This one had no such disclaimer, but it did have another review saying that there were some minor modifications needed for a G29.  I purchased the kit expecting to have to make some tweaks, but after taking a first stab at the installation I dont think that I need any tweaking.  It's secure and accessible without blocking the seat from raising up to get to the batteries.<br /><br />Only minor complaint, it would be nice if you could secure the spools at a certain angle.  Right now they seem tight because of the lock-washers, but I'm afraid they will start to swivel around and eventually scratch the cart's paint.  Time will tell, but it's still a very minor concern.

Input:I can't give an honest review just yet but I wanted to tell my thoughts after receiving this wig.  The package came next day so that was a big plus as I am headed out of town and wanted it quickly.  The packaging was nice but seemed old and had the barcode taped on the top, hair came in a plastic bag and is very, very soft.  Let me say the cap is way too small for my head, I will only be able to wear this wig with leave out, either I have a big a** head or this cap is small.  The cap is very good construction, sturdy the lace is soft and the silk top has good parting space but its a strange color, like spray tan color.  I put this hair in a sink of cool water and the water turned BLACK, maybe because I purchased a 1B and its the dye but I have washed this hair at least 20 time tonight and the water isn't running clear, I soaked it in ACV for about 2 hours and washed it again, there is a very strong smell that is still in the hair after all those washes, ACV and conditioner ( The smell of fabric softener in my hair makes me ill) so I guess eventually the smell will go away.<br /><br />Day 3... I could have taken the $160 I spent on this and thrown it in the air at the club, this tiny tangled mess was a huge waste of money. I can't blame anyone but myself, it's terrible I knew when I smelled it and got that itty bitty cap on I was wrong for purchasing this unit

After receiving the hair a pass my fingers through the lace frontal before I washed the hair was shedding a lit bit. I was scared. After I washed the shedding stop. I bleached the hair and thumbs up. The beautiful wave that comes after washed gone.  it has breakpoints hair and some red hair through the bundles and lace. But nothing that you cannot deal with and nobody can tell. For me, the bundles color was little darker than the frontal, but nobody can tell. However, the hair is beautiful, I really recommend buying this hair. I love the hair, it is beautiful a hair.

Input:They werent kidding when they say ""Death Grip!"" This stuff is serious! It has pine tar in it and you can definitely tell. It pretty much acts like straight pine tar, and holds perfectly. I will say that there is a learning curve to using it.....use the provided guitar pick to scrape some out (a little goes a long way) heat it up with a hair dryer or between the tips of your fingers, and use only the tips of your fingers to apply. Once you practice a little and figure it out, it works great! Note: I have only used Death Grip and not the other tin that comes with it.

Input:I could not find a forum for which to review Igora's Color Creme hair dye, so this forum will have to do. I am a man who decided to use a woman's hair color creme because there was simply no hair color creme for men that did not contain harmful chemicals. So I looked in THE SAFE SHOPPER'S BIBLE under hair care color dyes for women, which recommended Igora Botanica as safe. I purchased it and was sent a slim tube of creme. I saw some immediate problems. First, the box came with a warning that only qualified hair care professionals could use it without negating the product's safety warranty (whatever that warranty may be. The tube did not say). Then, the instructions told me to call for comments or questions--and then did not provide a phone number. I had to look in the SAFE SHOPPER'S BIBLE for the needed number. Third, when I called I got a recorded voice telling me to leave my name and number and somebody would get back to me. I am still waiting. Next,the tube did not list the ingredients so I do not know whether it contains harmful substances. Then, the instructions tell me that I must mix the color cream with another creme called Oxigenta, which was not included. Finally, the instructions for mixing the Igora with the Oxigenta were quite confusing. If this product by Igora is typical of the entire Igora line, DO NOT BUY IGORA.

Input:These were one of the easiest mask type products I have used.  The application process literally takes seconds.  Peel off and place on face and they stay there.  I left them on for 15 minutes and could definitely tell the difference afterwards.  As the package describes there is a little residue left when you take them off which yu just dab in.  Over all I was pleased with the effect, but not pleased enough to want to pay $7 for just the one set.

Input:I have not heard nor purchased this brand before. I ordered 5 of these sticks on sale at Kiko's website.  Consumers beware:  If you buy their products on sale, you can't return them.  Likewise, if you have used any of the products, you can't return it either.  Very poor customer service.  How can you tell if you like a product unless you use it first?  So this just does not make sense.  These cream eyeshadow sticks are very dry not creamy, making it hard to apply.  Nor is it pigmented.  I felt like I had something chalky on my eyelids.  If I could give this a zero rating, I would. Just total garbage.  Wasted $31 of my money.

Input:I used to have a revlon curler and barely used it. Over the years, the silicon pad eventually became too worn out and I decide to get a new curler and ordered new pads for my revlon curler and have it as a back up. It was hard at first, deciding on which one to order. There are over 6 eyelash curlers on Amazon, all with over 4 star ratings, having hundreds of reviews and all within the same price range too. How did I decide on this one? I don't remember honestly. But I can tell you that every time I put on mascara, I always use this curler. It seriously makes a huge difference. No wonder why I never used my revlon one. It is absolute crap compared to this curler. I have straight sparse Asian eyelashes and this curler effortlessly curls all of my lashes and keeps them curled. I can't currently comment on the longevity of this curler since I've only had it for a few months so maybe in a few years, I'll try to update this review if I remember. I honestly don't think anyone will regret purchasing this item. If you do, you really would be in the very small small minority.

Ġthing,ĠDo,"Input:This hair was thin, shedding, knotty and could not hold a curl… the natural hair itself was horrible. The bad thing was it looks great wrapped up but as soon as my hairstylist started to unravel the hair it started to knot up.  I’m the picture I posted… she used 2 packs and the ponytail was as thin as my little finger…I have never been So disappointed. I was at the weeding looking like a wet dog 🤦🏽‍♀️

Input:for me as soon as i used this i got rash like thing in my face i particularly used gold kit and my whole face was red after using this kit. it was ok after 24 hrs. I m scared to use other kits.
Output:negative
Input:I love this product. It's so light, looks like paraffin and turns from a firm salve like consistency to a very light oil when it touches your warm skin.<br /><br />I knew a woman in her 70s - 80s and always admired her beautiful skin.  One day I got up enough nerve to approach her and tell her how much I admired her soft, supple skin and asked her if she used any special creams to  keep it like that.  She told me that for many years the only thing she used on her skin was Albolene.  It was what she cleansed her skin with and what she moisturized with...day or night.  I purchased it and used it for a long time and loved the way it made my skin look and feel.  Now and then I would stop and use other creams and serums when reading all the magic results they promised, but my skin never got better than it did with Albolene and I always went back.  Once again I find myself trying out other creams but I have a backlog of Albolene and I'm pretty sure I'll be going back to it again.<br /><br />I also discovered that many stage actors use it for removing their heavy stage makeup.  A little of it goes a long way and I do love the scented one.  The fragrance is very light and doesn't last long, but I always love my cosmetics to smell nice.  It encourages me to use them.  Not strong scents, though.  They interfere with my perfume.  Not my Albolene!  And you have your choice of scented or unscented!  Same great product with just the tiny difference of a light fragrance that doesn't last long at all.

Input:Melindas has started using a new label on their bottles. Unfortunately these bottles of their Naga Jolokia with the new labels are not as spicy as they used to be. Melindas will not respond to my emails and their phone number on the side of the bottle/on the website doesn’t even work. This used to be such a good hot sauce, but bringing down the spice level just makes it another ok hot sauce. I was hoping it was just one bottle or one bad batch. It’s not. 4 other people I’ve turned on to this hot sauce said the same thing. Every bottle I’ve ordered in two separate orders is consistently not as spicy. If you can find the Naga Jolokia with the old labels buy those ones - they had the perfect flavor and heat. What once was a few drops on my tacos is now numerous shakes to get the same heat. That’s the American food business model for you - quantity over quality. I don’t think we’ll be buying Melindas anyone. We’ll start searching for something new. At this point Melindas is just like many of the other hot sauces out there.
Output:negative
Input:Please believe the reviews that say this thing dies pretty soon after purchase.<br />I bought this last August, and I absolutely loved it! I thought it worked really well, was so cute and a great bargain. Simply said, a great purchase. Now- the following March- the thing is dead.  It has been working on and off for a couple of weeks now but, if I hit the side, it would start working again.<br /><br />Today it finally croaked.  Now I have to look for a new toothbrush.
Output:negative
Input:First of all I like how portable this item is. It's very convenient for traveling or for small trips . The colors are very nice and pigmented. The only small thing for me is that I wish it was labeled.  Maybe since I'm not an expert at makeup,  it's hard for me to distinguish which one is just for lips, eyes and cheeks.
Output:positive
Input:I am going to try and make this review short and to the point. I got this wig in two days. Took it out the box and put it on, a hot mess but it fit. Not too big. Not too small. Then, I sprayed it with a little water and the magic started to happen...lol. This here is the best wig yet! I have never ordered a wig less than $90. The price is right. Let me tell you, I took this wig off. Rinsed and conditioned it. It did not shed. It did not tangle. I let it air dry, so soft . Very, very nice. And the thickness was perfect. Wig looks so natural.  I picked up my phone and ordered 3 more. Yes, not one but three. The only little thing that I wish was different is the lace. I wish it went ear to ear but the product is exactly as described.  Oh and this wig is not good for the price . It is better!!!
Output:positive
Input:Absolutely loved this hair!!! Only thing is I kinda have a bigger head so I needed one more pack for a full look. Other than that the hair is great
Output:positive
Input:For the price their perfect ! My blue glitter came open but it was fine cause I collected it back and put it in the container , even if I wasn’t able to I wouldn’t be mad because of everything you get . One thing I didn’t like is that all the jewels come together as one , they’re all connected with glue (see picture for close up) but it’s okay bc Im going to take scissors to cut and choose the ones I want to wear . Will update after the festival !
Output:positive
Input:I know for sure it didn't work for me. Not a single black head had been removed. Only thing it does is make your face smell minty. Waste of money.

Input:This diffuser dried my hair faster than any other diffuser I've owned even with a gentle air flow.  The best thing is that the spokes which stick out make it possible to dry hair next to your scalp without disturbing your curl pattern.  Smart design!  It fit my Babyliss Nano Titanium hair dryer perfectly.  For wavy or curly hair - I highly recommend this.
Output:positive
Input:This thing feels so good on my face. I hate putting on eye creams but I know I need to being almost 30 and this makes me want too! The smooth roller makes it so relaxing and easy to massage around my eyes. The big roller is great for my watermelon night mask. I love this thing. I even tried with out using the vibrate and it still feels amazing!
Output:positive
Input:this thing is pretty cheap. it bearly heats up. i have very long hair it takes forever to do with this brush iron.  just seams like the old kind grandma used to have
Output:negative
Input:They should really sell this with the hair dryer that goes with it. You spend so much time keeping the damn thing on it's really a shame.
Output:negative
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This hair was thin, shedding, knotty and could not hold a curl… the natural hair itself was horrible. The bad thing was it looks great wrapped up but as soon as my hairstylist started to unravel the hair it started to knot up.  I’m the picture I posted… she used 2 packs and the ponytail was as thin as my little finger…I have never been So disappointed. I was at the weeding looking like a wet dog 🤦🏽‍♀️
Output:negative
Input:for me as soon as i used this i got rash like thing in my face i particularly used gold kit and my whole face was red after using this kit. it was ok after 24 hrs. I m scared to use other kits.
Output:negative
Input:I love this product. It's so light, looks like paraffin and turns from a firm salve like consistency to a very light oil when it touches your warm skin.<br /><br />I knew a woman in her 70s - 80s and always admired her beautiful skin.  One day I got up enough nerve to approach her and tell her how much I admired her soft, supple skin and asked her if she used any special creams to  keep it like that.  She told me that for many years the only thing she used on her skin was Albolene.  It was what she cleansed her skin with and what she moisturized with...day or night.  I purchased it and used it for a long time and loved the way it made my skin look and feel.  Now and then I would stop and use other creams and serums when reading all the magic results they promised, but my skin never got better than it did with Albolene and I always went back.  Once again I find myself trying out other creams but I have a backlog of Albolene and I'm pretty sure I'll be going back to it again.<br /><br />I also discovered that many stage actors use it for removing their heavy stage makeup.  A little of it goes a long way and I do love the scented one.  The fragrance is very light and doesn't last long, but I always love my cosmetics to smell nice.  It encourages me to use them.  Not strong scents, though.  They interfere with my perfume.  Not my Albolene!  And you have your choice of scented or unscented!  Same great product with just the tiny difference of a light fragrance that doesn't last long at all.
Output:positive
Input:This is a great thing to have. We love it.

Input:Melindas has started using a new label on their bottles. Unfortunately these bottles of their Naga Jolokia with the new labels are not as spicy as they used to be. Melindas will not respond to my emails and their phone number on the side of the bottle/on the website doesn’t even work. This used to be such a good hot sauce, but bringing down the spice level just makes it another ok hot sauce. I was hoping it was just one bottle or one bad batch. It’s not. 4 other people I’ve turned on to this hot sauce said the same thing. Every bottle I’ve ordered in two separate orders is consistently not as spicy. If you can find the Naga Jolokia with the old labels buy those ones - they had the perfect flavor and heat. What once was a few drops on my tacos is now numerous shakes to get the same heat. That’s the American food business model for you - quantity over quality. I don’t think we’ll be buying Melindas anyone. We’ll start searching for something new. At this point Melindas is just like many of the other hot sauces out there.

Input:Please believe the reviews that say this thing dies pretty soon after purchase.<br />I bought this last August, and I absolutely loved it! I thought it worked really well, was so cute and a great bargain. Simply said, a great purchase. Now- the following March- the thing is dead.  It has been working on and off for a couple of weeks now but, if I hit the side, it would start working again.<br /><br />Today it finally croaked.  Now I have to look for a new toothbrush.
Output:negative
Input:First of all I like how portable this item is. It's very convenient for traveling or for small trips. The colors are very nice and pigmented. The only small thing for me is that I wish it was labeled.  Maybe since I'm not an expert at makeup,  it's hard for me to distinguish which one is just for lips, eyes and cheeks.
Output:positive
Input:I am going to try and make this review short and to the point. I got this wig in two days. Took it out the box and put it on, a hot mess but it fit. Not too big. Not too small. Then, I sprayed it with a little water and the magic started to happen...lol. This here is the best wig yet! I have never ordered a wig less than $90. The price is right. Let me tell you, I took this wig off. Rinsed and conditioned it. It did not shed. It did not tangle. I let it air dry, so soft. Very, very nice. And the thickness was perfect. Wig looks so natural.  I picked up my phone and ordered 3 more. Yes, not one but three. The only little thing that I wish was different is the lace. I wish it went ear to ear but the product is exactly as described.  Oh and this wig is not good for the price. It is better!!!
Output:positive
Input:Absolutely loved this hair!!! Only thing is I kinda have a bigger head so I needed one more pack for a full look. Other than that the hair is great
Output:positive
Input:For the price their perfect! My blue glitter came open but it was fine cause I collected it back and put it in the container, even if I wasn’t able to I wouldn’t be mad because of everything you get. One thing I didn’t like is that all the jewels come together as one, they’re all connected with glue (see picture for close up) but it’s okay bc Im going to take scissors to cut and choose the ones I want to wear. Will update after the festival!
Output:positive
Input:I know for sure it didn't work for me. Not a single black head had been removed. Only thing it does is make your face smell minty. Waste of money.

Ġlow,Ġseller,"Input:** This machine is dangerous!  I had it on low temp and after a minute or so it was scalding hot water!!!  It has no UL listing and nothing found when googling this company.  As another reviewer stated, the directions are terrible and in broken English.  I was afraid that I was going to break it trying to get it to open up. I should have never bothered to open it after seeing the functions on the box.  It stated pedicure feet ""adn""peel dead skin stated twice one below the other.  It also stated keep ""body"" warm and help sleep???Typo's in the instructions also.
Output:negative
Input:Small holes which worked great for me. My hair is about an inch long. Product exactly as pictured. Also comes with an instructional card. There are tons of instructional videos on YouTube. Price was very low. When I need another, I will definitely use this seller again and buy multiple sponges. Gels tend to flake so I prefer a leave-in-conditioner Mane 'n Tail.
Output:positive
Input:I recently got back into doing nails and was running low on a few things. This kit had everything I needed for a good price :) The files etc work very well. Good price for the amount of items you get.
Output:positive
Input:This was super low quality<br />Peeled off within days
Output:negative
Input:Great soap.  These bars are big, bigger than a typical sink soap dish, but they are great for the shower and they last a long time.  Their cost per use is still not as low as super-cheap supermarket soap, but these are high quality and last much, much longer.  Much better choice, I think.
Output:positive
Input:It looked good out of the package, it is very soft, I washed it.. but when I tried to curl it the hair was sticking to the iron like it was synthetic. Only takes low heat. Very disappointing.. was an excellent deal before that. I love the Vpart and how it’s structured. Looks very natural. It’s very light. It’s just the hair quality. It looks placticy on the ends. Maybe it’s a blend? Nonetheless - was expecting 100% real hair and I don’t feel like I received it.
Output:negative
Input:I use it under the shower, otherwise I make the entire bathroom wet. It may be just me who doesn’t know how to manage it lol. Pressure is very good. I keep it on number 1 or 2. Above 2 is too much for me. Battery life is excellent. I use it every night and only once in a month of use it blinked and showed that the battery was low. I love it.
Output:positive
Input:So I’m actually returning this because I used it once only for it to stop working on me. It was working well but after about 15 minutes of me using it the fan suddenly switched to low.... I thought I accidentally hit the wrong thing but then it just stopped altogether. I tried turning it off and then back on again. It worked for like 2 minutes then just switched off again.
Output:negative
Input:I have always preferred a sheer polish, mostly white. Lately it's been close to impossible to find. Through my searches, I found Esse. I've hit the jackpot in the sheer collection. I chose Sheer Luck, which has a very low hint of pink. I am pleased to write this great review because this Essie is a great polish. Goes on smooth, no smudges or streaking as it's applied. Dries fast and even faster when I apply ""out the door"" as a top coat.  So very happy to give this an all around 5 star as it deserves just that.
Output:positive
Input:Great low-price item for my friend's child. The formulas are a lot better than I expected.
Output:positive
Input:I was skeptical of the pheromonal element of this product because I had a Booty Parlor Flirty Little Secret Perfume Oil - which is highly acclaimed - which I felt did absolutely nothing but moisturize my skin.  I bought this because I wanted this scent of oil in a rollerball bottle and hey, if the pheromone thing worked, added bonus.  WELL.  My husband is not the super affectionate type, but I am, so I'm always the instigator and beggar of attention - his struggle with low-T doesn't help.  I had this oil on for 15 MINUTES, and my husband was all over me - we had multiple Afternoon Delights! ;)  I hadn't even reapplied for the whole day!  I also noticed that I got more eye contact and smiles from people in public who made sure to say at least Hi to me, but I haven't had but two public experiences wearing this stuff, so it could just be the confidence from the extra attention at home.  I read a lot of reviews of people getting a lot of positive attention, people being nicer and such, and I will agree that - whether directly or secondary to subsequent effect - this stuff does put me in an amazing mood.  I actually got on Amazon today to buy more, even though I've only just received this product.  So I felt a review was in order.  The awful thing about this product?  It doesn't come by the gallon.  BUY IT.
Output:positive
Input:The heat is very low
Output:negative
Input:Looks really good for such a low price, bangs are a smidge shorter than I hoped but it's really cute and the color gradation is lovely and looks like a fancy salon balayage. Minimal shedding and a wide tooth brush goes through pretty easily.
Output:positive
Input:I love this product  I have black hair which is dyed brown and blonde balayage it gets brassy quick ..I also have kids which means I don't  have lots of time for salon visits or home maintenance... this is a foam it doesnt  stain ur clothes u just throw it on clean hair I leave it on and add more for 2 days then wash it ..it tones it low maintenance  and I've done 3 tones out of one bottle so far I still have product probably  get 2 more treatments  out of it
Output:positive
Input:The polish is a good product, however, sending 3 pastel shades and 6 colors that are pink or peach was not acceptable or appreciated.  This sends a message to Sally Hansen customers that SH just wants to move excess and/or low sale products.  Is this the message they want to send to loyal customers or new customers like me, who will balk at buying more products? SH may have nothing to do with this the composition of the colors in this set but I don’t know this.  What I do know is that it is a Sally Hansen product…

Ġgood,Ġwig,"Input:I love the bands themselves but I don't much like the color. The bands are very stretchy and hold my hair in a pony tail without slipping. These bands are good quality and are put together with a small bead. There are 10 of each color 20 total in a package. It comes with a velcro piece that holds the bands and keeps them in one play. I would recommend the HBY High Quality Pony Elastics by HBY. Sample provided without obligation.
Output:positive
Input:I curled one eye with a regular eyelash curler and the other with Sekalar heated eyelash curler. There was no difference. The company sent me a $15 gift cerificate if I gave it a 5-star review but I couldn't because the good reviews is what suckered me into buying it.
Output:negative
Input:Bought it as there was this 45 days not good money back garantee. But I liked it. I have a difficlut skin, but no problems with this shaver. Believ Philips is doing a great job in their constant development of their shavers. Happy men!
Output:positive
Input:Was looking for a natural organic dry shampoo, after using mostly spray aerosols products with really strong scents, I wanted something natural, in a powder form. I had seen the Captain Blakenship  dry shampoo on a few sites before, so wanted to try it out, the cost was relatively more affordable then some other brands out there. So far, I love it. The scent is subtle but very nice, container lid has a few different ways of sprinkling the product out depending on how much you want to use. I have thick medium/long length hair, and used the dry shampoo today on 3rd day hair and so far so good. I have dark hair, and the white powder blends well into my roots/hair, i even sprinkled some onto my hands and tousled it into my hair for some texture. Would def purchase this product again.

Output:positive
Input:This is mislabelled. It is listed as a pack of two for 15.97.  However, each order is only one stick of deodorant. I thought i was getting 4 sticks, but only recieved 2.  The product itself is good, but not $16 for a stick of deodorant good.
Output:negative
Input:I love this case! I love the fact that I can adjust the size of the compartments in it. Lots of room for all my stuff. I only wish the compartments were deeper. I also noticed in a lot of review that people are saying the key has no use, however; my key works just fine in locking my case. This is a great case and a very good deal price wise. I will most definitely recommend it!
Output:positive
Input:This shampoo and conditioner set is wonderful. This is my first time using Shiseido's Tsubaki line and I'm very pleased with the product. My hair feels silky smooth and less frizzy. The shampoo and conditioner also smells good - I'll be purchasing another set once I'm done with this one.
Output:positive
Input:I purchased three.  One each for my daughter, son-in-law, and grandson.  I really like this model because it uses AA batteries and you don't have to worry about a charge.  Just pack it and keep a couple of extra batteries around and you are good to go!  My son-in-law said the first time he used it he felt like he had a professional cleaning from the dentist office!
Output:positive
Input:Gave to kids.  Not good coverage.
Output:negative
Input:May be good for others, but after trying it on feels like it’s pulling my shoulders together and forward. Returned
Output:negative
Input:If it’s too good to be true, .., these are not SOULVATION.  You get what you pay for.  RETURNED IMMEDIATELY!!
Output:negative
Input:Delivered on time and as advertised. Very good with product made with good ingredients. Works well as a conditioner and feels really good on my hair. Have been using this product for a few weeks and recommend it
Output:positive
Input:The order got to me fast. This is good stuff. Been using it for years. Glad to see it’s available from Amazon
Output:positive
Input:I wouldn’t say these toothbrush heads are as good as the Oral B brand, Id day they are BETTER! Great value, I will definitely continue to buy them & recommend them to anyone who has an Oral B electric tooth brush.

Output:positive
Input:This is a great mud mask to use for a weekly routine. The mask is a fine smooth consistency that you apply in a thin layer over your face and let dry (which takes a few minutes) and rinse off. I use a cleansing cloth or small face towel to remove, which doubles as an exfoliator when removing. It tightens your skin and really wakes you up. Because it's not harsh, I have used it withing a few days of my previous use as a skin brightener.<br /><br />In the way of mud masks, I like that you can get the effects of a mud mask without having to apply a thick layer which takes 10+ minutes to dry. This is a lot faster and just as, if not more, effective,
Output:positive
Input:Wished it came with the bottles for the beads as pictured. Beads come in little bags and not the exact amount of 100, I Was gipped on some of the beads.
Output:negative
Input:I have minor redness on and around my nose, and this is the ONLY foundation I’ve found that really sticks to my nose - and for hours. It can be applied for full coverage but, aside from my nose, I apply it lightly with a soft foundation brush, and I’m happy with the more transparent coverage. I’m in my 60s and I do have drier, crinkly areas. Even though this is a powder, it isn’t drying, and it’s got just a slight glow that makes it look natural. No other foundation works as well on my face.
Output:positive
Input:Not only do they come in super cute colors (I'm a sucker for neon), but as a licensed nail technician, they do the job wonderfully. The super fine grit gets the acrylic and Polygel sets that I do silky smooth, and are also well made so they don't crumble apart. I will definitely be re-ordering soon!
Output:positive
Input:The clippers arrived in a case held together with scotch tape. They are dull and too big to do anything. Very disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:DO NOT ORDER!!! I ordered this lamp on March 10,2021 and today is May 20, 2021 and the port that  connects to the lamp detached and I assume it's in the body of the lamp because when I shake it I hear something rattling. This is a piece of CRAP!!!!!
Output:negative
Input:This product did nothing to firm or redefine my chest, it did however make me reek of toothpaste all day.  There was a slight tingling sensation when the product was first applied, but it was obviously due to the huge amount of peppermint or something in the cream, hence the toothpaste smell that lingered.
Output:negative
Input:Great comb, just be prepared to get either purple, black or gray.  I got two of each in my 6-pack.
Output:positive
Input:So far so good!  Holds my extensions well. you just have to be careful where you clamp the hanger down on the hair, because if clamped on too much of the hair it will leave a dent.  That is not a design flaw, just inevitable with any product like this.  It's not the best made material, but for the price it does the job!  And it's pink!  I bought two of these, and separated my extensions in half.  I can't see holding 10 welts in this, and that's what I currently have.
Output:positive
Input:Love this product. Works fast. Save time in the morning as only a quick coat of mascara works wonders with this product. The is a beauty staple for me.
Output:positive
Input:Only use this on areas where the hair is sparse, but definitely still exists, so thinning brows, etc. If you try to use this to fill in &#34;bald&#34; spots on your eyebrow, it will just stain the skin for a day or until you wash your face. Due to this you also cannot use this to correct brows where one is higher than the other, longer than the other, unless there is hair on the exact spot you are trying to paint the dye onto. Used in conjunction with regular a regular brow pencil, this product is OK, but if I still need the pencil then it's not worth the time to me.
Output:negative
Input:I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.

Input:My bundles (16” 18” 20”) arrived looking nice but they shed so much!!! I washed them and now they are matted and nothing worked to soften and release the tangles.

Ġan,Ġsmall,"Input:Just opened my ice face mold and the product had black hairs on it and an orange/brown residue on the silicone. HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR THIS ELSEWHERE!
Output:negative
Input:This device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws.  On a functional level, the vacuum is virtually useless so that at least 2/3 of the hair winds up on the counter or in the sink.  I could have stayed with my non-vacuum trimmer!  Also, the blades clog and everything comes apart to clean with a flimsy, I hope I don't break this, kind of plasticity.<br /><br />On an aesthetic level, this is very noisy and the noise is extremely unpleasant, sort of a sick screeching sound that I do not associate with quality.  As soon as I turn it on, I want to turn it off as soon as possible.  This just does not feel like a quality product.  It is within a hair of it being worth the trouble to return it.
Output:negative
Input:The problem I have with this case is the dividers are flimsy felt Valero and don’t stay up to make different compartments.  Otherwise it’s an ok case.
Output:negative
Input:These are nice brushes in different color choices. It's a nice sticking suffer! Received on time, no issues. I received this product at discount for an honest review
Output:positive
Input:I have no idea what anyone would use this brush for. I thought the size and the type of bristles would be good for my Maltese. The wire brushes irritate him and they always seem to poke me. I have a self-cleaning brush that I do love that I use on my cats. They seem to love the wire bristles scratching them too, but would rather not. I have to comb him and it takes an hour to get through it. So I thought this might be the answer. No. It won't even get into the hair. I did however find a wire brush that is amazing!  ""Paw Brothers Extra Long Hard Pin Slicker Brush, but it only comes in a  Large. If this was like 3 inches wide it would make my dreams come true. The longer bristles pick up his hair and doesn't have to be touching his skin to do it. He sits very calmly for that brush, its just awkward for me on such a little guy.
Output:negative
Input:Very weak smell in comparison to other anise I have used which translated to no increased catch rate and shipping took forever.
Output:negative
Input:I purchased the 7d head shaver and after about 2 months of semi-regular use and cleaning as specified by the manufacturer, the device can hardly get a grip on my hair to shave and has developed an incredibly irritating high pitched whine/screech to it. It was loud and annoying when I first turned it on but I could deal with it as the cost of having an electric shaver, I never expected it to be silent. This new shrieking noise is unacceptable. It always took multiple passes to get a decent clean shave on my head, but now it takes an exponentially greater amount of passes with the shaver to get anywhere close to a shave with this device. The accessories, when used with a light touch as described in the manual, have also developed structural issues and are also unusable. One can expect this device to last about 2 months before becoming garbage.
Output:negative
Input:I jut put these in a couple days ago so I cannot attest to quality after wearing, washing, styling etc but they are shiny, thick and easy to install when you receive them.  The color of the hair matches great to my hair.  My only complaint so far is the loop/bead is way too light for the actual strand.  It is extremely noticeable.  I expected it show a little since I have darker roots grown out in the back but in the front and top sections of my hair where it is naturally lighter at the root, the loop/bead stands out and shows when my hair pulled back.  As long as my hair is down, it isn't an issue but it looks as though as I have mini hair clips throughout my hair when pulled back.  The color of the bead needs to match the hair more, it definitely is not as pictured.
Output:negative
Input:Is it supposed to be clumpy and not smooth when applying? It didn’t do much for removing the polish, had to apply 4 times and wait a few minutes between times to see any change. And even then, had to scrape a lot as never saw the “bubbling” everyone else talks about. Maybe I got an expired batch. Can’t return because I immediately threw away the box.
Output:negative
Input:An eyeliner that I am actually happy with! It took me a bit to get used to the brush but once I got the hang of it, it became an absolute favorite. The color of the eyeliner is DARK. Do allow some time for it to dry after applying.
Output:positive
Input:I don't write review often, but this is an absolutely must have item in your house! It heals ridiculously fast, even the deep cuts and burns if you start using from the beginning in less than a week you won't even have a scar. A true miracle cream! I am buying the second one for my grandmother right now
Output:positive
Input:After a couple of uses I saw an immediate improvement in my skin. Diminished KP on my legs and the bumps on the back of my arms. Also used on my face and woke up with the best even-toned glowing skin. Highly recommend, will repurchase once I run out.

Input:We are always looking for a plain water bottle for use on clothes or hair, and these blue glass bottles are the perfect solution!  The two-pack of spray bottles both provide a consistent spray mist, and also a targeted spray, based upon which setting the tip is turned to.Tight seal on caps, until you try and turn the spray nozzle.  When you turn it, it loosens the cap, and occurs on both bottles. The black labels stay secured through washing and the black color doesn’t detract from the deep blue color of the bottle.  We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn’t leave the carpet feeling saturated.  We are happy with the bottles, except that the lid comes undone when adjusting the spray nozzle.  Just be careful to re-secure so you don’t spill water or whatever else you may put in the bottles.

Input:This headband with speakers has been a really great buy. The sound quality is good and after a month of use, the product is holding up very well and is very comfortable. I use it as a sleep mask even when I am not listening to anything. I got a newer iPhone and had to buy an adapter since this plugs into an earphone jack. I highly recommend.
Output:positive
Input:Gem single edge razors have always been an excellent product. They are no longer sold in Walgreens and CVS pharmacies in my area. I'm glad Amazon has them as part of their inventory.

Output:negative
Input:This device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws.  On a functional level, the vacuum is virtually useless so that at least 2/3 of the hair winds up on the counter or in the sink.  I could have stayed with my non-vacuum trimmer!  Also, the blades clog and everything comes apart to clean with a flimsy, I hope I don't break this, kind of plasticity.<br /><br />On an aesthetic level, this is very noisy and the noise is extremely unpleasant, sort of a sick screeching sound that I do not associate with quality.  As soon as I turn it on, I want to turn it off as soon as possible.  This just does not feel like a quality product.  It is within a hair of it being worth the trouble to return it.
Output:negative
Input:The problem I have with this case is the dividers are flimsy felt Valero and don’t stay up to make different compartments.  Otherwise it’s an ok case.
Output:negative
Input:These are nice brushes in different color choices. It's a nice sticking suffer! Received on time, no issues. I received this product at discount for an honest review
Output:positive
Input:I have no idea what anyone would use this brush for. I thought the size and the type of bristles would be good for my Maltese. The wire brushes irritate him and they always seem to poke me. I have a self-cleaning brush that I do love that I use on my cats. They seem to love the wire bristles scratching them too, but would rather not. I have to comb him and it takes an hour to get through it. So I thought this might be the answer. No. It won't even get into the hair. I did however find a wire brush that is amazing!  ""Paw Brothers Extra Long Hard Pin Slicker Brush, but it only comes in a  Large. If this was like 3 inches wide it would make my dreams come true. The longer bristles pick up his hair and doesn't have to be touching his skin to do it. He sits very calmly for that brush, its just awkward for me on such a little guy.
Output:negative
Input:Very weak smell in comparison to other anise I have used which translated to no increased catch rate and shipping took forever.
Output:negative
Input:I purchased the 7d head shaver and after about 2 months of semi-regular use and cleaning as specified by the manufacturer, the device can hardly get a grip on my hair to shave and has developed an incredibly irritating high pitched whine/screech to it. It was loud and annoying when I first turned it on but I could deal with it as the cost of having an electric shaver, I never expected it to be silent. This new shrieking noise is unacceptable. It always took multiple passes to get a decent clean shave on my head, but now it takes an exponentially greater amount of passes with the shaver to get anywhere close to a shave with this device. The accessories, when used with a light touch as described in the manual, have also developed structural issues and are also unusable. One can expect this device to last about 2 months before becoming garbage.
Output:negative
Input:I jut put these in a couple days ago so I cannot attest to quality after wearing, washing, styling etc but they are shiny, thick and easy to install when you receive them.  The color of the hair matches great to my hair.  My only complaint so far is the loop/bead is way too light for the actual strand.  It is extremely noticeable.  I expected it show a little since I have darker roots grown out in the back but in the front and top sections of my hair where it is naturally lighter at the root, the loop/bead stands out and shows when my hair pulled back.  As long as my hair is down, it isn't an issue but it looks as though as I have mini hair clips throughout my hair when pulled back.  The color of the bead needs to match the hair more, it definitely is not as pictured.

Ġwrong,Ġbreak,"Input:I liked the smell of the patchouli, initially, and was interested in trying a different natural deodorant, but I won't be purchasing this again. I actually got a fungus in my pits (no joke) after using this and discontinued after a month. I then had to use miconazole nitrate spray for two weeks until my pits got back to normal. This natural deodorant isn't intended to stop sweating (it's not an antiperspirant) but it seemed to clog my pores and make me additionally sweaty. The ingredients look fine, and seemingly benign, but something went very wrong after using this. I have gone back to my former antiperspirant and write this as a warning to anybody who happens to start getting itchy flaky dark skin in their pits after use.
Output:negative
Input:Not the highlighter that is advertised!!! Instead of the Models Own Sculpt and Glow highlighter in golden sand I got their pressed finishing powder in golden sand which is way to dark for me. I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />*Update: messaged the seller about the error and got to me pretty quickly, they sent me the correct product and a return envelope to send out the wrong one. Thank you! The highlighter is beautiful
Output:negative
Input:Mirror is &#34;warped&#34; and you have to hold it at a very precise angle to be able to see in it clearly, otherwise it gives a distorted image. I use magnifying mirrors quite a bit, but there is something wrong with the image in this one. Almost like the old circus mirrors that intentional disproportion or distort.
Output:negative
Input:Not impressed. I'm not sure if I just purchased the wrong one for me, but I I most likely won't buy another to find out. I really wanted to like it but it caused me to break out.<br />It is thick! I held the my palm to soften, like it said. But it was still so thick, even what softened on my hand was like rubbing wax.<br />I waited between the first and second times I used this, but I broke out heavily both times I tried it.
Output:negative
Input:I bought the ""Vanilla Rainbow Sprinkles"" fragrance on another website, as a substitute for Bath & Body Works' ""Confetti Cake Pop"", which had been sold out everywhere that I had looked online. I was under the impression that the two scents would be similar enough so as to not make much of a difference. I was, unfortunately, very wrong.<br /><br />""Confetti Cake Pop"" is awesome, and it smells just like what the packaging says, ""creamy cake frosting."" Delicious! ""Vanilla Rainbow Sprinkles"", on the other hand, is one of the few Bath & Body Works' scents that I heartily dislike. For one thing, the vanilla scent is very muted; not in a good way, as in subtle, but in a bad way, like ""I can barely notice the vanilla in this perfume."" If that was the only thing about ""Vanilla Rainbow Sprinkles"" that was off, I could live with it.<br /><br />After I had sprayed it on myself, however, I became aware that there was a strong under-note of alcohol. I do not wish to smell like rubbing alcohol when I put on scent. Just awful. That bottle will be going into the trash can, and I will not buy ""Vanilla Rainbow Sprinkles"" in the ""mist"" (or in any other B&BW product) ever again. It is disappointing, as I usually have good luck with Bath & Body Works, and I enjoy many of their fragrances. I have to also comment that, unusually for Bath & Body Works, the artwork on the product label is very dull and is rather uninspiring.<br /><br />Looking for a sweet, fun scent that is good enough to eat? Instead of ""Vanilla Rainbow Sprinkles"", I would recommend Bath & Body Works' ""Sugared Snickerdoodle"", if you cannot find ""Confetti Cake Pop"".

Input:This is my first time trying on press on nails and I just love them. The instructions on the package are in Chinese I guess but I received instructions through email in English which was very helpful. The quality of the product is very good. I did put on a few in the wrong direction but was able to rectify it without any problem. Love my nails. Would definitely buy more
Output:positive
Input:I was initially skeptical about this serum but I’m happy to say I was wrong. I have been using this serum for a while now and my eye lashes and eyebrows are actually fuller. I have been trying to get my eyebrows to fill in and this serum has Truly done the trick!
Output:positive
Input:Ordered 3 minute gel. Received a body spray. Received replacement and it was wrong as well. Extremely disappointed. Did not want 1 minute gel. It does not work. The reason I was willing to pay over $15 for clear polish is due to the great results I had experienced with prior use of the 3 minute gel. Never again.
Output:negative
Input:Roger & Gallet is a premier soap and toiletry company which can be counted on to provide a quality product.  This lovely green tea-scented soap is no exception.  The beautiful sturdy cardboard box comes with three individually-wrapped soaps. It would make an excellent hostess gift.<br /><br />Although the scent is subtle and lovely, I was a bit disappointed that the soap itself is yellow.  It's a pretty soft yellow, but I was rather hoping that it would be green to match my decor.  That said, I would purchase this soap again in a heartbeat.  Another reviewer mentioned that the green tea scent is particularly nice for both men and women and I would agree.  I will also try the lily of the valley as mentioned by another reviewer.  It was my mother's favorite flower.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with these lovely soaps.<br /><br />Recommended.

Input:I believe I was sent the wrong color my braids are much lighter than pictured product that’s why I could not leave 4 star review. I do like that the hair is prelooped so installation went pretty smooth. Hair quality is good I did trim mine ends some. 6 packs was enough to do a full head but probably could’ve used 7pks to fill in.
Output:positive
Input:At first I was very excited to recieve this .... but upon trying, the brush bristles on the smaller brushes are just to tight for eye shadow application. All of the brushes (except the largest three) do not pickup/hold product as they should. The Too Faced Chocolate Bar is my daily go to for eye shadow and the product just does not go on the brushes properly at all. The density of the bristles is just all wrong. Don't bother purchasing.
Output:negative
Input:this is the one ! i bought some before from a different company but the plates and the sticks were all wrong, because i had played with it in  JAPAN and this is good, very close as in good quality from the ones i played in JAPAN, like it !
Output:positive
Input:I thought, one piece, great... I was wrong. First, this feels terrible on my scalp. That may just be me. I tested it to see how it would work after I had already brushed my hair with my normal brush but instead it tore out my hair. I have no idea how that happened but it did it with both brushes. I then decided to try it with a few tangles in my hair and it wouldn't pull through... I would not recommend these...
Output:negative
Input:These were horrible; especially trying to install them! They were thick, rough, and the hair wrapped around to create the butterfly lock slipped in all the wrong places. I had to end up throwing away a bunch of them that tangled up and I was unable to untangle them. Now, I am not a novice with doing crochet braids whatsoever. And these were difficult and unwieldy for me! I struggled through getting 3/4 of my hair done, through sheer perseverance and will, before I finally gave up, cut them out, and threw them in the trash. My hair looked like a hot mess!! I would never buy these again. Totally not worth the money!!
Output:negative
Input:The product is exactly as described by the seller, it's just not right for me. I've been using it twice a day for a over a week, and it still feels like it's sandpaper/pumice stone on my skin. It exfoliates but in a bad way, it's way too rough for my sensitive skin.<br />I ordered this because I'm reducing plastics in my household and my old loofah was one of those fluffy plastic ones. So I figured I'd go natural. Basically, I got the wrong kind of loofah, at least for my needs. It's great for when I wash my feet and armpits (I use a natural zinc based deodorant so it's kind of difficult to wash off with the fluffy plastic loofah) but it's way too rough for the rest of my body.<br />I soaked it as instructed, because it does come flat as a board and dry as can be, but I have to soak it before every shower or it's intolerable-that's a pain. I'm going to use them all, of course, but I already have my next style of natural loofah picked out.<br />I also noticed that I have to use a lot of soap, way more than normal. It has softened a bit with use, but you can still cut glass with the edges.<br />If you need extreme full body exfoliation, this is the product for you. My sensitive skin is just not having it. The seller was very clear in their description so it's my own mistake, and I don't blame them at all. It's a good product but I deducted a star because I absolutely hate it, for me. I can totally imagine this is right for someone else.

Output:negative
Input:Fit my 8 year old perfectly. A little big for my 4.5 year old but I tie a small knot on the elastic ear loops and they fit fine. I’ve reordered these several times now and are our go to masks as my kids hate cloth masks.
Output:positive
Input:This product came in a timely manner, however the black paint was dried out, I could not get the top off, and when I did it was crumbly as if very old. The foil and images did not work! I followed everything to a tee several times, and at the end of it all I just wanted a refund! If I could give it zero stars I would. Don’t waste your money!
Output:negative
Input:I do like the Turban Twist but I do have to take it off and put it back on at least three times before my hair feels dryer.  I do have thick hair but my hair is never completely dry as shown.  I do like the way my hair feels seems softer and more manageable.
Output:positive
Input:Love,love this hair. It is very soft,no shedding, it had no smell. I purchased 3 times,because you can only buy one at a time. Good quality. Great price.
Output:positive
Input:Bought these for my daughter’s softball team. We had to do snacks a couple times in the season and this just made it fun for the girls.
Output:positive
Input:This was such a disappointment!  After using it 3 times, it stopped working.  My husband opened up the fuse area to find the fuse blew.  We bought a new fuse, but it didn't work. Then my husband took the drill to Ace Hardware where a sales rep opened the unit and found that the motor went out.  I tried to reach out to the seller, but to no avail.<br />We bought this in December, and by February the thing was dead!  $60 bucks out!!!
Output:negative
Input:I loved this product. I have used it three times over the past 6-8 weeks. I didn’t think it was going to peel, but the fourth day is when I see the best peeling. Being summer time, I know I will need to get more to keep from having crusty feet
Output:positive
Input:I like the quality of this item, but it is a bit too powerful I use it now once a week in the shower because there is no way to dial it down & it’s very harsh & therefore can be messy. It was quite comical the first time. The water has to be refilled several times in one cleaning.
Output:negative
Input:I can change my hair color as many times i like without damaging my as much. The smell is not so great but it only lasted for a couple of day.
Output:positive
Input:My nails can be brittle at times so painting them can become troublesome since they are more prone to splitting and breakage when you put that coat or 4 on. Worse is when its time to take it off and the nail polish remover dries the nails out even further and leaves them more prone to damage.<br /><br />But this has been working out rather well despite my nails being brittle at times! I think the formula is made to not be so harsh on the nails and its effective even on these nails I tap and use constantly on a keyboard all day (so they are all the more likely to break eventually, but especially so after taking nail polish off) So far, so great!
Output:positive

Input:These clips are so cute and i have seen similar clips at stores for like 4 times this price. I ordered 8 clips and they are all cool and different. I am a funky 29 year old, so I wear funky hair clips.
Output:positive
Input:Let me start with this: I have worn these lashes every single day I have worn makeup for over the last two years. I wear makeup 6-7 days a week. I don’t ever write reviews but honestly these deserve it for how much I use them. These are my absolute go to. They are perfect for some office drama or going out. I have hooded eyes so I used to really struggle to find flattering lashes but about these are perfect. I am not kidding when I say I have worn these lashes hundreds and hundreds of times.  Every single photo of me over the last couple of years, guarantee I am wearing these. A pair holds up great and can be reused up to ten times if handled well enough. I will be so lost if these ever disappear from Amazon cause these are a staple. If you like a little drama and length but still wearable, these are it. You cannot beat the price either. I still can’t believe I found these! &lt;3
Output:positive
Input:This is a very nice large bag. Used it several times already and it feels like good sturdy material. I would definitely recommend.

Ġsecond,Ġjob,"Input:[[VIDEOID:f06b9db5060ce4a2d23f1544ddc90a6c]] My only complaint is that I wish I could order the smaller sized ones as well. I ordered the 3oz one and you get 1 smaller bottle with the order.<br /><br />But I LOVE THESE BOTTLES. They are super easy to use. And great with thick products like castor oil and thing products like 91% alcohol!!<br /><br />At first I was like where is the little straw thing that should be in the middle?! I was so upset with myself for possibly buying the wrong bottles and I was about to send them back without even trying them. Then I watch a reviewers video and read other review and decided to try the bottles myself. I filled one with a thick oil mixture and the other with alcohol (because ya know, covid and all). Both the spray bottle and the pump worked!! I was so excited. I used to keep my oil mixture in a dropper bottle that was so messy but now with this pump it so much easier. I have also dropped the bottle I filled with alcohol a lot. On the driveway a few times so far no cracks or leaks. And I love how sleek the bottles are. I’m going to place a second order so I can have an extra set.<br /><br />I’m so glad I tried them. In order for the bottles to work both the pump and stay, they need to be filled to the top so the product can be sucked into the tiny spout. These bottles do not require the little hose thingy to work. So don’t be like me and a few other reviewers who freaked out about that.  Just fill the bottle to the brim and it will work just fine.
Output:positive
Input:3rd time ordering this product 1st order was perfect everything worked well no missing pieces. However second and 3rd orders were missing clear stopped for the top of the tube. Which makes it useless. I was missing 11 stoppers this time. Being off by maybe 1 is okay at times but 11 is unacceptable. Guess you get your money’s worth
Output:negative
Input:Bought this wig because it was a great deal for the 13X6 inch lace they were stating it was! But it was only about 2inches of lace. Had the item replaced, to give the company the benefit of the doubt, but was sent the same wig with almost no lace. Very disappointed! Sending the second one back as well. The hair is soft, but very thin, but not absolutely terrible. The thinness is expected if it had more lace, but it doesn’t. Not worth it if you ask me.
Output:negative
Input:Company made me go through a long process of pictures etc. to claim lifetime warrantee. I did this and received a second brush. I really like how this brush works on my face. It stays charged for a long time, but never will recharge... so I am at the same place again. Read other similar reviews. Too bad a nice product just will not recharge..
Output:negative
Input:This is my second bottle of JWOWW and it is as described. It smells good and feels good and I don't smell like a tanning bed afterwards.
Output:positive
Input:I got 5 days out of them, glued-on.  The thumb tips literally melted the second day and I had to cut them short. The nails faded and started cracking on day 3 and I could not wait to change them on day 5. I won’t buy this brand again.
Output:negative
Input:This lasted me only two trips. On the last trip it ripped where you can hang it and the pouches ripped open. It is a very low quality.  Love the look and all it holds but it doesn't roll nicely the second anything is put in it is wont close.
Output:negative
Input:I ordered this for the first time about a year ago I think and it was AMAZING. Best mascara for $5. So I ordered it again for the second time a few weeks ago, NOPE. One tube was completely dried up and the other one had the wand broken off inside so o couldn’t use it. I sent them back for an exchange and the second shipment was two completely dried up tubes. Totally unusable. I’m just using the brush with another tube of mascara at this point. Will not be buying here again. SAVE YOUR TIME and skip this. The good reviews are clearly from old batches.
Output:negative
Input:I get so many compliments after shower the smell stays hours after it’s amazing it’s my second bottle and definitely buying more
Output:positive
Input:I ordered 5 sticks and they arrived within about a week. The first stick I opened had a white substance stuck to it (see pictures). a second stick I opened did not have the same substance. The three other sticks also do not seem to have the substance on them, but I have not opened them. Some of this white stuff feels wet and slimy, while on other parts of the stick, it is dried up and crusty. I could not find any expiration dates nor any information on what the white substance could be on the packaging. I have not used any of the sticks out of concern for my safety. The smell is quite potent up close. The two sticks I opened smelled about the same. It is hard to describe because I have never smelled anything like it.

Input:Dried up eyeliner, second time ordering magnetic lashes with the liner and liner was all dried up and unable to use
Output:negative
Input:This was my second one. It quit working (couldn’t switch out bits) after 2 uses. Not worth the trip to return it. Took a long time to get confirmation return was accepted. I had to call to make sure it was received.

Input:This is the second set I've ordered as gifts. Worth the money to get a quality set that cuts cleanly, with little effort.
Output:positive
Input:Just bought my second unit because the first one did not last and finally died of corrosion. The new unit started acting up after two weeks. The problem is that the brush head and battery compartment do not have a waterproof seal. Water or worse gets in and corrodes and the unit stops working. Leave it for more than a couple of days without cleaning and drying inside and you will have some very slimy growth. Be sure to look at the customer photos supplied for this product ...The leakage and corrosion is exactly what to expect in a very short time.<br />UPDATE 9/8/2013<br />Despite extreme care to keep unit dry, water gets in and corrodes.<br />Finally contacted Philips after having two fail in less than a year. No problem they said they will send me a replacement. But it is the base and stand of a plug in model they are sending -- THEY NO LONGER OFFER THIS BATTERY MODEL

Input:This product literally fell apart in the middle of a hair trimming.  This is only my second trimming in two months.  I would like a refund please.  It cost me $51.74 cents.  I have only had it since May 31, 2020.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:[[VIDEOID:f06b9db5060ce4a2d23f1544ddc90a6c]] My only complaint is that I wish I could order the smaller sized ones as well. I ordered the 3oz one and you get 1 smaller bottle with the order.<br /><br />But I LOVE THESE BOTTLES. They are super easy to use. And great with thick products like castor oil and thing products like 91% alcohol!!<br /><br />At first I was like where is the little straw thing that should be in the middle?! I was so upset with myself for possibly buying the wrong bottles and I was about to send them back without even trying them. Then I watch a reviewers video and read other review and decided to try the bottles myself. I filled one with a thick oil mixture and the other with alcohol (because ya know, covid and all). Both the spray bottle and the pump worked!! I was so excited. I used to keep my oil mixture in a dropper bottle that was so messy but now with this pump it so much easier. I have also dropped the bottle I filled with alcohol a lot. On the driveway a few times so far no cracks or leaks. And I love how sleek the bottles are. I’m going to place a second order so I can have an extra set.<br /><br />I’m so glad I tried them. In order for the bottles to work both the pump and stay, they need to be filled to the top so the product can be sucked into the tiny spout. These bottles do not require the little hose thingy to work. So don’t be like me and a few other reviewers who freaked out about that.  Just fill the bottle to the brim and it will work just fine.

Input:3rd time ordering this product 1st order was perfect everything worked well no missing pieces. However second and 3rd orders were missing clear stopped for the top of the tube. Which makes it useless. I was missing 11 stoppers this time. Being off by maybe 1 is okay at times but 11 is unacceptable. Guess you get your money’s worth

Input:Bought this wig because it was a great deal for the 13X6 inch lace they were stating it was! But it was only about 2inches of lace. Had the item replaced, to give the company the benefit of the doubt, but was sent the same wig with almost no lace. Very disappointed! Sending the second one back as well. The hair is soft, but very thin, but not absolutely terrible. The thinness is expected if it had more lace, but it doesn’t. Not worth it if you ask me.
Output:negative
Input:Company made me go through a long process of pictures etc. to claim lifetime warrantee. I did this and received a second brush. I really like how this brush works on my face. It stays charged for a long time, but never will recharge... so I am at the same place again. Read other similar reviews. Too bad a nice product just will not recharge..
Output:negative
Input:This is my second bottle of JWOWW and it is as described. It smells good and feels good and I don't smell like a tanning bed afterwards.
Output:positive
Input:I got 5 days out of them, glued-on.  The thumb tips literally melted the second day and I had to cut them short. The nails faded and started cracking on day 3 and I could not wait to change them on day 5. I won’t buy this brand again.
Output:negative
Input:This lasted me only two trips. On the last trip it ripped where you can hang it and the pouches ripped open. It is a very low quality.  Love the look and all it holds but it doesn't roll nicely the second anything is put in it is wont close.
Output:negative
Input:I ordered this for the first time about a year ago I think and it was AMAZING. Best mascara for $5. So I ordered it again for the second time a few weeks ago, NOPE. One tube was completely dried up and the other one had the wand broken off inside so o couldn’t use it. I sent them back for an exchange and the second shipment was two completely dried up tubes. Totally unusable. I’m just using the brush with another tube of mascara at this point. Will not be buying here again. SAVE YOUR TIME and skip this. The good reviews are clearly from old batches.
Output:negative
Input:I get so many compliments after shower the smell stays hours after it’s amazing it’s my second bottle and definitely buying more
Output:positive
Input:I ordered 5 sticks and they arrived within about a week. The first stick I opened had a white substance stuck to it (see pictures). a second stick I opened did not have the same substance. The three other sticks also do not seem to have the substance on them, but I have not opened them. Some of this white stuff feels wet and slimy, while on other parts of the stick, it is dried up and crusty. I could not find any expiration dates nor any information on what the white substance could be on the packaging. I have not used any of the sticks out of concern for my safety. The smell is quite potent up close. The two sticks I opened smelled about the same. It is hard to describe because I have never smelled anything like it. I would say it smells like what radishes taste like, in combination with a strong chemical smell. It is not pleasant, although some people seem to like it. Cannot comment on the intended use because I am concerned to try it.

Ġsee,Ġcase,"Input:I like it , I see that my eyelashes are growing.
Output:positive
Input:The color was more of a pink shade. Also, the hair is falling out a lot. You can see the patches on Theo top of the wig. It’s okay for one time use for Halloween I guess. But doesn’t worth the price
Output:negative
Input:Got this for Mother's day; I was really excited as I have many wonderful Korean Sulwhasoo products, but those are really poor quality in comparison. Disappointing. All &#34;creams&#34; or &#34;emulsions&#34; in this set are the same texture and color and smell the same...I don't see any difference. The descriptive booklet does mention what is in the set but as there are five 30 ml bottles and no indication in English on the bottles, you have no idea what each 30ml bottle actually contains... bummer. Will not reorder.
Output:negative
Input:Didn't see any change.

Input:I got this to tighten up my jawline and man can I feel it.<br /><br />The jaw exercise is great. super easy to use and convenient. it comes with a little rope that you can put through it so that when you are not using it you can jus let it hang around your neck. I use this between sets while I am working out at home and it's amazing. I can already see the results starting to appear. Clearing is super simple just take out the 2 plastic guards for your teeth and let them soak for a while then you can wash them like you would anything else.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product if you are looking to tighten you jaw line like me. High quality product!
Output:positive
Input:I waited a few weeks before writing this review, because I wanted to test it out and report what my results were going to be. The smell is light and clean, light citrus and lavender or lemongrass.  Very nice.  It must be shaken, and the texture is smooth but not sticky or watery.<br />I love the texture of my skin once it dries. I can still add my moisturizer and my makeup goes on flawlessly. Not the case with other serums.<br />I can tell my skin is brighter for sure.  I'm watching an age spot to see if it lightens that. I'm quite pleased and will be buying this again
Output:positive
Input:I have been using magnetic lashes for about a year, and I never thought they would look, and work so well. Once you apply the liquid magnetic base, you can try different lashes, to see which pair matches up with your makeup, and wardrobe. This might sound like extra work, but that is the whole point of these. They are extremely easy to apply, and swap. They really look great, and I finally gave them a try, and wear them all the time.
Output:positive
Input:This diffuser is very difficult to use. The slightest amount of pressure sends the thing collapsing on itself while in use. It got so hot at one point that it wouldn’t even stay put, it collapsed in on itself on one side and I couldn’t get it to work. I gave up and decided to return it. I can’t see how they even charge $15 for this item. It’s terrible! I’d rather purchase a hair dryer with a hard diffuser included. Don’t waste your time or money on this item.
Output:negative
Input:This flat iron came very nicely packaged including a nice carrying bag.  The iron is sleek and black, easy to handle.  When turning it on, I realized a problem with not being able to see the numerical temperature for which you are setting the iron, as it just has a turn style indicated with no arrow to show the temperature setting.  You only know whether you are turning the temperature up or down.  Using the wand is nice, other than not knowing the real temperature.  It does a nice job of ironing the hair.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Review of: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DPMKDVH?th=1<br />""PARWIN PRO Hair Straightener Flat Iron 1 Inch - Ceramic Flat Iron for All Hair Styles with PTC Heating Auto Off Salon Hair Ion Straightener for Short Hair Black""
Output:positive
Input:Very cute at first but quickly becomes tangled and “unravelly”. On to the next... in search of cute lightweight hair that doesn’t become a matted mess!  I wish Amazon made it easier to get in contact with other reviewers. Sometimes I wish I could follow up with other folks on here so I could see what they tried that did work!
Output:negative
Input:She says it works better than the older one that she handed down to our niece. Nice to not see the halo of glowing fuzz when she is backlit.
Output:positive
Input:The clip that comes with it arrived broken and rendereethis useless. I tried to get it to hold up but had no success. I would have to purchse ANOTHER clip to see if it might work.
Output:negative
Input:Instructions are primitive and difficult to see clearly. I dropped the bowl in my sink and it separated at a seam and doesn’t go back together! I will use a mason jar which should work. It has a lot of parts(attachment for brushes ) it does spin and dry brushes out pretty good. I am not going to return it, but probably should.
Output:negative
Input:Living in a shared space, I need something for my own lotions and soaps, but also something that won't clutter up my space. These were the perfect solution. The plastic feels nice and durable, and the nozzles so far haven't clogged. I like that they are clear so I can easily see what is in them.
Output:positive
Input:It does have a lil sheerness but if you apply a tick layer you will be fine super easy to use ... but my concern was the top coat it was a lil Lumpy as you can see if ya can see on the pictures it’s was like sugar Particles in it but Besides that they are good.

Ġreviews,Ġnormal,"Input:Super disappointed when opening these brushes after I got home from work today to find that the brush head on the first brush I took out fell right off.

Input:First let me tell you about my lashes. My lashes stick straight out and the ones on the outer corners curve down :( and I have small eyes so it seems the other eyelash curlers that I have used never got my eyelashes on my outer corners very well. I have used lots of different eyelash curlers  and they have the same problem which is they did not curl my lashes on the outer corner and the ones that did get curled everywhere else only held the curl for a few seconds so I would have to immediately apply my mascara. I got the Bella and Bear curler yesterday at work and I had to use it as soon as I got the package, I opened the pretty box the curler comes in and I took it to the bathroom I did not have any mascara with me but I really wanted to see how good it curled my lashes. After I used it on one eye there was a huge difference, it curled every eyelash even the ones on the outer corners then I did my other eye it came out beautifully also and sense I did not have any mascara with me I could not put any on so I decided to see how long the curl would hold. I checked 30 minutes later and the curl was still there and not only was it still there it was a much better curl then any other curler had given me even right after I would use them. When I got home I decided to see how it looked with mascara and it was the best my eyelashes have ever looked. In fact my 6 year old has very pretty dark curly lashes and when she seen me after I curled and applied mascara with the Bella and Bear she said mom your eyelashes look so pretty like my eyelashes.<br />When I seen this curler on Amazon I was hesitant to buy it because of the price and I was not sure if it would really work like the description and reviews said but I was so tired of how my eyelashes were before so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy that I did. I will never use any other curler again.

Input:I believe the reviews on this product are fake. They don’t have one bad review, but I guess I’ll be the first.<br />The product is Super Oily (i was reading another reviewer and they said they use one pump per eye..) I only used one pump and my eyes were drenched in this stuff... it’s really Heavy on your eyes.<br />It also doesn’t work... I’ve used eye products for a while now and I can usually feel that they are working on my eyes... I used this, and nothing happened for my eyes.<br />The worst part is that you can’t return it. It’s like they’re fooling customers to believe their product is “great” with all of these good reviews and once you buy you can’t return it.<br />I wouldn’t recommend this item, it doesn’t work.

Input:I am only giving 3 stars right now because it is a good oil.  I would like to use this for more than a few days. So far, I like the oil, feel it is a high quality oil and will try to get back here to give an honest review in 3-6 months. I am using this in a lush essential oil blend for skin.<br /><br />**8/19/16** I wish there was an easier way to keep up with reviews like this. I had initially listed this as a three star review. Main reason for that is because reviews are requested within days and for most products I purchase, that is rarely enough time for an honest opinion that others can rely on.<br /><br />So to update my review after way more than 6 months of use. I LOVE the product. I have found Egyptian Carrot Seed Oil (along with sea buckthorn oil) to be one of the best nutritive ingredients to include in a blend I create for hydrating aging skin. This is a really good price for such a high quality carrot seed oil. Thank you Shea Terra Organics.

Input:Straight out of the box, never in my entire extensions wearing life have I ever seen extensions so beautiful. Y’all, the color was exactly the one in the picture (the rooted silvery grey). I have shoulder length ONE COLOR blackish brown hair. I do not have any blonde at all whatsoever, but now I have a beautiful balayage to my waist.<br /><br />I waited a couple weeks to give a good real review so here it is:<br /><br />They’re consistent. I had to purchase an extra pack (I use 3-4, my hair is crazy thick and I have a giant head) about 2 weeks after my initial purchase and they were exactly the same in color, texture and tapes.<br /><br />The hair is stunning, and I mean wow. They’re better looking in color and texture than my several hundred dollars worth of glam seamless (remember, I use 3-4 packs and GS hair is like 200 a pack).<br /><br />They can handle life. Some tape ins just can’t hang. They look and feel good for about 2 weeks then they’re just kinda separated and stringy and just don’t handle the grow out well. These extensions are ready to party. I wore them in the pool- still beautiful and silky afterwards.<br /><br />I have hard water. I have to buy filtered shower heads frequently because the water is just so bad (farm life) but these extensions have stood up to hard water just fine.<br /><br />If you’re on the fence about what brand to buy, try this one. I bought the 1b/silver combo from 2 other manufacturers with positive reviews only to be really pissed off about how inaccurate their description was.

Input:I just finished nursing my child and wanted to take care of myself starting with skincare. I had acnes back in highschool. I tried multiple laser treatments and it did very little to clear up my acnes scars. Plus one laser treatment cost atleast $500 and they quoted that I would need about 10 sessions to clear up my skin. That would be $5,000! So I did 3 laser sessions which had very little result and tried to do home treatment such as salicylic peel, retin a and dermaroller.<br />I strongly advise not to use salicylic or other peels at home as I burnt my skin and have permanent scar from it.<br /><br />Retin a is good that it brighten up my skin but did little for my acnes scar or shrink pores. I tried dermaroller with vitamin c & hyaluronic serum but it really did nothing for my skin.<br /><br />I read a skincare article that human stem cell containing EFG could reduce pore size & acnes scars. As I have tried many methods before, I was hesitant to purchase another item but just gave it another last try.<br />I searched and found Anterogen human stem cell skin pack. I read all the reviews and googled more information about stem cell skincare. There are two stem cell that is in the market. One is plant based( apple stem cell) vs human stem cell. You can google this yourself but all the articles state that plant based stem cell does nothing for your skin. It has to be human stem cell! So I purchased this brand as it had the highest amount of human stem cell.<br /><br />I sanitized my dermaroller (1mm) in boiling hot water for 5 mins. I washed & dry my face  then apply Anterogen white silk timeless machine serum on my skin. Then roll dermaroller roller over my face applying more serum on punched skin. Then finished it with this human stem cell mask. I left it on my skin for 30 mins. I also squeezed left over serum from mask on a facial bowl and tapped it on my skin and left.<br /><br />The next morning, omg my pores &acnes scar finally looked smaller!! I literally teared up as I have found something that could help my skin look better. I am planning to do dermaroller every 2 weeks using Anterogen human stem cell serum with mask. Remember, don't over do it as skin needs downtime to recover and produce new collagen to fill up pores, scars or wrinkles.

Input:The ends of the hair was extremely thin. I did return for a refund. You can go to your local beauty supply and purchase this type of hair.. Please pay attention to the most recent reviews and not reviews from a year ago.. I wish the thick bundles that are being advertised were the same hair destiny we purchase.

Input:I almost never write reviews but this sincerely made my life so much easier. I love to have sparkly nails but I hate the process of removing the polish. This makes the removal process so quick and easy. It lasts a full week for me, which is the longest I leave polish on for before changing color. It took me a little practice because the first time I put it on way too thin but just paint like any other base coat.

Input:I liked this product at first as it rubbed in well and was easier for my four young children to use as it wasn’t heavy and sticky like typical sunblock.  However, after a week or two of use, my oldest daughter (9) started developing a rash on her neck.  It took me weeks to figure out what was causing the rash and I spent a lot of money changing lotions, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, laundry soaps, etc.  Her rash got open and raw all around her neck and behind her ears and it was so painful she would cry when we tried to put steroids and lotions on it.  My Second daughter (8) and my son (5) also started to get a rash on their necks during this time, and then last but not least my husband.  None of our family have sensitive skin just fyi.  We finally figured out it was the sunblock and a few days after stopping it and treating with meds, their rashes are finally improving.  To be fair, myself and my 2 year old son did not get a rash, although we used it less as we stay inside more and try to stay in the shade as much as possible when out.  I read a few other reviews that mention this same issue, especially around the neck area and I just want you to be aware so that if this happens to you, you don’t waste valuable time and resources trying to figure out where the rash came from.

Input:What the heck is going on?  There isn’t any brunch inside.  Sure wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered 2 packages.  How are these suppose to stay in my hair.  Who would ever know to check if there was a brush inside?  I feel like l was taken for a buggy ride!

As I have tried many methods before, I was hesitant to purchase another item but just gave it another last try.<br />I searched and found Anterogen human stem cell skin pack. I read all the reviews and googled more information about stem cell skincare. There are two stem cell that is in the market. One is plant based( apple stem cell) vs human stem cell. You can google this yourself but all the articles state that plant based stem cell does nothing for your skin. It has to be human stem cell! So I purchased this brand as it had the highest amount of human stem cell.<br /><br />I sanitized my dermaroller (1mm) in boiling hot water for 5 mins. I washed & dry my face  then apply Anterogen white silk timeless machine serum on my skin. Then roll dermaroller roller over my face applying more serum on punched skin. Then finished it with this human stem cell mask. I left it on my skin for 30 mins. I also squeezed left over serum from mask on a facial bowl and tapped it on my skin and left.<br /><br />The next morning, omg my pores &acnes scar finally looked smaller!! I literally teared up as I have found something that could help my skin look better. I am planning to do dermaroller every 2 weeks using Anterogen human stem cell serum with mask. Remember, don't over do it as skin needs downtime to recover and produce new collagen to fill up pores, scars or wrinkles.
Output:positive
Input:This broke within it's case while in my purse between a single car ride. I'm disappointed in the quality of the product because it had such good reviews.
Output:negative
Input:The ends of the hair was extremely thin. I did return for a refund. You can go to your local beauty supply and purchase this type of hair.. Please pay attention to the most recent reviews and not reviews from a year ago.. I wish the thick bundles that are being advertised were the same hair destiny we purchase.
Output:negative
Input:If i had went off what i read in the reviews o would not have bought. I love them they are used for parting and that’s what i use it for.
Output:positive
Input:I almost never write reviews but this sincerely made my life so much easier. I love to have sparkly nails but I hate the process of removing the polish. This makes the removal process so quick and easy. It lasts a full week for me, which is the longest I leave polish on for before changing color. It took me a little practice because the first time I put it on way too thin but just paint like any other base coat.
Output:positive
Input:I liked this product at first as it rubbed in well and was easier for my four young children to use as it wasn’t heavy and sticky like typical sunblock.  However, after a week or two of use, my oldest daughter (9) started developing a rash on her neck.  It took me weeks to figure out what was causing the rash and I spent a lot of money changing lotions, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, laundry soaps, etc.  Her rash got open and raw all around her neck and behind her ears and it was so painful she would cry when we tried to put steroids and lotions on it.  My Second daughter (8) and my son (5) also started to get a rash on their necks during this time, and then last but not least my husband.  None of our family have sensitive skin just fyi.  We finally figured out it was the sunblock and a few days after stopping it and treating with meds, their rashes are finally improving.  To be fair, myself and my 2 year old son did not get a rash, although we used it less as we stay inside more and try to stay in the shade as much as possible when out.  I read a few other reviews that mention this same issue, especially around the neck area and I just want you to be aware so that if this happens to you, you don’t waste valuable time and resources trying to figure out where the rash came from.
Output:negative
Input:What the heck is going on?  There isn’t any brunch inside.  Sure wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered 2 packages.  How are these suppose to stay in my hair.  Who would ever know to check if there was a brush inside?  I feel like l was taken for a buggy ride!

Input:I bought this professional care deluxe toothbrush because it was considered one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes and it came with many attachments.  What I didn't expect was that the unit did not hold up well at all.  After 1 year the metal piece where you attach the cleaning heads became stuck and stopped working. When I called the customer service representative I was told that my unit could not be serviced because the problem resided in the base unit which they said could not be opened and fixed. Therefore even though I was in the warranty period they would not be able to service my unit nor give me a new one to replace the one I had. They absolutely refused to honor the two year warranty that comes with all their toothbrushes. The only thing they offered was a coupon for $10 off a new toothbrush. I'd say that's misleading and I would never have bought the unit with that kind warranty.  As far as how the unit operated during the year I had it I found the toothbrush only worked well with the dual-action brushhead (very hard to find replacements), and all the other accessories are a waste of time and money.  The tongue cleaner does nothing and the smaller head I found did not hold enough toothpaste to clean the entire mouth very well.  I also found the charging very slow and the flashing blue light would be very annoying. Also the base and toothbrush would get very dirty if you did not clean it regularly.  My final comment is I will never buy another Oral B toothbrush again based on how it cleaned my teeth and the poor customer service when it stopped working under warranty.  I'm back to spending another $80 on another brand which I'll review after I've tried it for some time.

Input:First, I'd like to THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR REINVENTING THIS BLOW DRYER.  I MUST SAY HAVING EVERYTHING PARALLEL ACROSS AND DOWN MAKES A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF HAIR THAT GET BROKEN OR DAMAGED WHILE BLOW DRYING.  I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL OTHER ONE STEPS BLOW DRYERS, INCLUDING THE REVLON AND THEY ALL HAD TOO MUCH OF MY HAIR ON THEM AFTER I WAS FINISHED.  THAT WAS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS BLOW DRYER.<br /><br />I AM NOT KNOCKING ANY OF THE OTHER BLOW DRYERS WHICH I TRIED BECAUSE THEY ALL WORKED, BUT THIS IS THE BEST ONE TO ME.  NOT ONLY HAVING THE BRITTLES AND PARALLEL IS AWESOME AND GREAT FOR THE HAIR, BUT ALSO THE LOCATION OF THE CONTROL.  I KNOW WITH THE TWIST ONES, I OFTEN TURNED IT OFF.<br /><br />AGAIN, IT IS AWESOME!!!  I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU TRY THIS BLOW DRYER.<br /><br />A VERY PLEASED AND SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!

Input:Idk if they sent the wrong color but I’ll add pics soon - it is SO Fake looking- also came in very poor condition.. its very soft but also NOT BROWN its platinum blonde with dirty blonde roots it’s WAY brighter than as shown and the band at the hair line is almost .3 cm thick i dont even think its salvageable but ill try styling again- i was going to return but i cant go in to a store and i dont have a label to return it so guess im out 25$ 😒

Input:Did nothing to take off the nail polish for me. The gel just came off in one big gloopy strip. Bubbles up slightly but man did this stuff do damage to my nails would have gotten less damage than regular acetone. Only tried it on my left hand. I’m glad i didn’t try with both.
Output:negative
Input:I bought it for my daugther and she is trying it out.  She never had a brush with Boar Bristles so thats what she will see if she likes.  She has always had the plastic ones.  so far no complaints!!
Output:positive
Input:I was using Honest Amish but I find that the Liberty balm provides more control with FAR less greasiness even when using the absolute minimum amount of Honest Amish. And as for softness, my wife says the beard is as soft if not softer than before. The scent is masculine but dissipates very quickly. Although I liked the scent, Honest Amish was stronger and at times even started to go a little rancid if I accidentally used too much.<br /><br />I have definitely converted.  Liberty Beard Balm is awesome.

Input:I bought this toothbrush because it was a gold box savings and needed to replace my other Oral B. I am so happy with it. My teeth feel ""squeaky clean"" after using it and it doesn't ""tickle"" my gums like Sonicare did.  It has a great battery life and two different speeds.  After a few weeks, my teeth look whiter and I had a lot less plaque at my last dental appointment.  My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased.  In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!

Input:I really liked this toothbrush until I discovered that it didn't hold a charge for more than 2 brushings.  I was going to return it and exchange it for another one but found out that evidently others also had problems with it, so Amazon stopped selling it.  I did order an Oral B Professional Care 1000, which is slightly less ""deluxe"", and, so far, am happy with it.
Output:negative
Input:I love love love this stuff! Previously I've used the wingliner stamp in classic black but wanted brown, and nobody seems to sell it. Found this and love the green and blue so much, I haven't even used the brown yet. It's super pigmented and perfect. Very smudge proof, have to remove it with Clinique Balm take the day off. This is a good thing cuz my eyelids are oily and this eyeliner doesn't budge.

Input:Update- the replacement quit working today. Two times I used it and it quit- don’t waste your money on this…<br /><br />The first time I received this item, I got 1/2 way finished with my hair before it errored out on me and completely quit working. I had a replacement sent to me and so far, I've not had any issues with this one burning out. I've used it once and its super simple and easy to use. Unfortunately, I don't like the curls it gives me- It curls all the way down to the ends and I'm just not fond of how it looks. I think it would probably be good for a child's hair but not mine.

Input:I really like this product. I am very mixed. I mean VERY- my one little head has about 4 different hair types! I kid u not. 1st pic is my hair post wash and no product in it. (Natural)<br />I wanted to wait a full week before writing this review to make my judgement. I did NOT follow the instructions that were on the bottle ( not exactly anyway)<br />I washed my hair with clarifying shampoo rinsed and blow dried 80% like the bottle said. Sectioned hair and applied the product-USE GLOVES! I left it in for a good 40 mins and then instead of rinsing I flat ironed my hair... it was miraculous... 2nd picture....<br />I was a bit worried about leaving product in my hair overnight so I waited a few hours and I washed and conditioned it... applied a moisturizing hair mask and after 20 mins rinsed it out and blow dried it completely. ... 3rd picture..... my curls were much softer and if I wanted to apply product I could have done so and left it like that but I opted to flat iron it out.... 4th picture..... i LOVE HOW SOFT IT IS!!!! It's been a full week and I just have to touch up minor areas every other day.  I really love this product! I will definitely be purchasing more! I'm still left with half the bottle... the products smell was not overbearing... the process was not overtly long....<br />5 stars from me!

Input:I thought these would give loose, lasting curls, but they are impossible to keep on for any length of time because they are so unwieldy. Ordinarily I sleep in this kids of curlers, but one cannot sleep in these at all.

Input:I bought this wig for a costume event in 2020 that was canceled due to COVID. Now two years later, I am finally able to attend. I pulled the wig out of it's protective bag to double check that the curls were still intact, and realized that this wig is barely chin length, not shoulder length as the photos suggest! The wig cap is also very tight and will undoubtedly give you a migraine after an hour. This was a waste of money and now I have to order a second wig for my costume.
Output:negative
Input:It's smells so good a coconut smell and it works! I am a white female with waist long hair medium thickness and I have natural body in my hair I take a shower pat my hair brush it while its wet then put this on my hair flip it a few times and go people always ask me what I put in my hair because it smells so good. And it helps my hair to give me a little more body and bouncy curls. With my length there's a lot of weight so my natural waves don't stay bouncy with this as long as I don't use a brush and just finger comb it while out and about it my curls can last almost 6-8 hours if my hair starts to lose the curls and starts getting puffy I can just get my hands wet and finger comb it and the curls are back for a few more hours.

Input:I've been a topper wearer for several years and wanted to go with a full wig for a special occasion.  Right out of the package, I was impressed with the beauty of this wig.  The Ombre coloring is very attractive, and the curls are simply gorgeous.  The only problem that I had was that the hairline just doesn't promote a natural appearance.  I tried to blend the hairline with my own hair, but nothing I seemed to do made this look even remotely natural.  I think this is a very nice wig, but I will probably only be able to wear this using a headband or scarf until or unless I can figure out how to make the hairline more natural appearing.<br />Pros:<br />+The cap has a nice weft with breathable layers.  It is adjustable with nice combs to help secure the wig.  While I wore it, the wig felt secure without being tight.<br />+The synthetic hair is a decent quality with beautiful curls that really only required finger-combing to make them look very nice.  I saw no fraying or damage to the ends.<br />+This wig laid nicely on my shoulders and made me feel very attractive outside of the issue with the hairline.<br />Cons:<br />-As I've mentioned, the hairline doesn't really allow a very natural appearance.  Even if I were to think the hairline, I just don't see this appearing natural.  It could really use a lace front.<br />-I'm used to relatively lightweight toppers.  The density and length of the hair made this much heavier than I was used to.  While the cap was comfortable, I think If I were to wear this for any length of time, I might get a headache.

Input:The part looks great- the color looks like real scalp.  The hair is soft and not too shiny.  The curls are beautiful.  That being said, the curls don't actually go as long as in the pic.  It looks like little boy hair.  It's super short.  If it were a few inches longer it'd be great.

Input:I love my Bio Ionic 10x blow dryer but was dissatisfied that it didn’t come with a diffuser as I have a lot of curly haired clients who need to be diffused. After purchasing the diffuser from their brand, I was happy until it started to become exceedingly loose within a month or so. The diffuser head is very large which makes this nice for quickly drying hair, but a bit of a storage issue for small salon stations or bathroom counters. For the price of the diffuser head, I really expected the rubber seal to be more heat resistant and sturdier overall, and for the almost 300$ that the bio ionic 10x blowdryer is, I wish they would have included this attachment at the very least. That said, for home use it’s probably great, and I do love the adjustable air flow because I can reduce airflow at the end of a blowout to make sure flyaways don’t lead to frizz and the curls stay nice and defined throughout the service.
Output:negative
Input:This hair is great quality for the price, I was skeptical at first, but when I received the package and finished the install I was absolutely thrilled. The hair is beautiful, the curls aren’t too silky at the end.<br /><br />Tips to make it last: spritz the loose hair ends with either braid spray or fabric softener. Remember, it’s synthetic fiber and the fabric softener does wonders to keep the curls detangled at night. Sleep in a long satin bonnet. Be good to your scalp, have a scalp spritz and scalp oil.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very impressed with the hair quality and how it lasted. I get nothing but compliments.  I’m already almost a month in with the hair and it looks amazing, but I’ve gotta take it down.<br /><br />Although I did need to use some extra goddess locs (my stylist made it extra full but I didn’t want that) I still loved it, so the packs you receive should be enough for your whole head, especially if you’re doing an illusion method.

Ġreason,ĠHowever,"Input:This is my most favorite conditioner out there. I have issues trying to find conditioners that don't weight my hair down or make it sticky or fluffy and dry. This is by far the best one I've found. I have very dry, thick, wavy hair. I know people are complaining about the alcohol that didn't used to be in this hair conditioner, but that doesn't effect my hair at all. Infact it improves mine. The reason why I like it so much is because it really smoothed and hydrates the heck out of my hair. I put it on for 10-15 minutes in my shower and then rinse it. It makes my hair so smoothe and silky feeling. Also, the scent us yummy smelling, I don't know why no one likes it. My husband especially loves it. 😉
Output:positive
Input:This shaver really is a treat to use. I have had no difficulty with the ""grade"" of shave slipping mid shave and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.<br />The shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I'm using.<br />So far I've had four shaves off the one charge and I shave once a week, so the battery seems to hold its charge really well.<br />Cleaning is a cinch.<br />It's noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer. It's certainly not anything that's a detraction from the shave.<br />The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because of the area just under the nose, the other reviewers that have mentioned this are correct - it's very hard to get to this area without contorting your nose and/or lip.<br />I simply remove the protector and do the last few hairs freehand with the open shaver or a pair of cuticle scissors.<br />The overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.<br />Very nice carrying bag too included.
Output:positive
Input:This is a great set! Every piece gives a different effect to your art, and can be used with nail stamping.<br />As shown in the video review, this set comes with a great case, and is well protected.  You can also see that one of the brushes (3rd in from the right) is slightly lopsided, and that is the ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars.<br />Overall, this is great set.
Output:positive
Input:The Product came fast but with one problem. A battery is included because its on the box. But mines have no battery at all. Dont know how someone could take it out but they did. Thats my reason for 2 stars.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this mirror for my mother, it worked great until I had to change the batteries.<br />When I put brand new batteries in the base, the mirror will not come on.<br />It will work when you use the adapter, but the only reason I bought this expensive mirror is that it was battery operated.
Output:negative
Input:I got this wig because of the reviews thinking it would be a good alternative to the ones from the hair companies. The main reason for ordering this wig was the two day shipping. I hoped for the price it would be higher quality since it is only $20-30 more expensive for this length on the hair sites. The wig came i did my usual, cowashed it in cool water then let it air dry. THE ENDS WERE SO RAGGEDY!!! I contacted the seller through Amazon email. They got back to me asking for my cellphone number I asked why, they asked for the shipping information connected to my account. I gave them the info, I then received two text late at night from two different numbers asking for photos of the wig. I wouldn't have mind sending photos through email, but to take it upon yourself to text without my permission is not okay. I gave 2 stars because I have just been wearing the wig in a puff/ponytail and it is still convenient but not what I paid for.
Output:negative
Input:This shaver is not a smart investment.  We sent it back for repairs once at a cost of almost $9 for shipping.  Yes, they sent us a brand new shaver, BUT it is now not working again and it has less than 6 months.  My husband had a Braun for years and for some reason he thought Wahl would be a better shaver.  NOT SO.  I don't just want good customer service, I want a product that works.  How many times do you pay shipping before you make a decision that the product is not worth it.  Once is the answer for me.  Not doing it again.  Counting my loss and buying a Braun.
Output:negative
Input:I've used it for about 3yrs and I use it as a base coat. I noticed that my regular nail polish last a lot longer than usual compare to any other base coat. Of course if I get my hand wet a lot or wash, it last less. But, I try to use gloves whenever is possible. The reason I give 4 stars is because when I'm half way or less than half way it starts to become sticky and stringy.
Output:positive
Input:I've been using liquid body wash years but started thinking about the plastic waste from the bottles and went looking for a solution that would allow me to use bar soap but not end up with the slivers left over. This seems like a reasonable compromise. The mesh bags hold the soap and allow you to use all of it, down to the very last tiny piece. They foam up nice and the mesh bag provides a bit of scrubbing like I'd get from a standard shower puff. It's a bit tricky to use when switching from hand to hand as you have to try and keep the drawstring closed so the soap doesn't fall out but the drawstring is what allows you to hang the bag after your shower, which keeps it from getting sticky and covered in slime. That's the reason I went with mesh instead of a natural, woven material as a lot of the comments were that the bags disintegrated quickly and got sticky and gummy because they couldn't dry properly between uses.<br /><br />These seem sturdy enough like they'll last through several bars of soap. And the pack of 20 means I'll have enough for me (a single person) to last for awhile.<br /><br />The reason I deducted a star is the excessive packaging. The irony for me is that I got these to get away from buying plastic bottles (that can be recycled). These came individually wrapped, wrapped together in another bag, inside a bigger bag - none of which can be recycled. Seems a bit excessive for mesh bags.
Output:positive
Input:I've had this diffuser on my desk for almost exactly 30 days. I have used it nearly every day as well. The Oscillation was a neat feature -- but I have just disabled it. For some reason it has started squeaking at one point after it has moved all the way to the left and has started its right-ward movement. Rather disappointing that one of the key ""features"" is basically dead on arrival. Failing after &lt;30 days is not acceptable by any measure.<br /><br />The rest of the features are pretty good and it does a great job with an area that is approximately 30x14. The interval mode does seem to work very well all things considered and a single ""fill"" lasts from Friday evening through Sunday --- used mid-afternoon till around midnight each day.<br /><br />I am unsure if I would purchase it again. I have the Jasmine at work and it has been flawless. Although I supposed that should be expected -- it has fewer moving parts.<br /><br />Update 2020/01/22: I'd have to say at this point -- I wouldn't buy one with the oscillation again. It seems that feature has marginal benefits and if it fails can be pretty frustrating. As of today, about 3 months into ownership, the oscillating mechanism jerks severly and seems to bind. If the motion is halted it works great. The run-time seems close to advertised although I've never tried to time it. So from that perspective it works as advertised.

I am one of those people that care a lot about what goes on my body. I also liked that it clearly states for users with sensitive skin to use this product at night and to also use sunscreen with this product. I have sensitive skin and often have to find out the hard way if it's going to break out my skin. I was happy to see it did not and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth which is great because this Florida heat dries out my face so much. Absolutely an excellent product, only reason I did not give it a perfect 5 was because I don't believe anything can be 100% perfect but this comes close. I recieved a discount for this product in return for my unbiased honest opinion.

Input:I bought this soap for my beard and decided to go whole hoge with it. I travel and camp alot so I didn't want to lug around a bunch of different soaps and shampoos and beard guck. So far I like it... everywhere, my beard is not as course and unruly as it used to be and my hair and skin feel much cleaner than before. I also use honest amish beard balm on my beard and hair. I have only been using for about a week and if the results stay consistent I may order more.<br /><br />The only problem is that the bar is dissappearing fast and for some reason Maple Hill Naturals does not offer a five pack of the Black Forest Beard wash. I can handle 5 bucks a bar but not eight. Hopefully Maple Hills will offer a five pack.
Output:positive
Input:I'm pretty sure this is fake. It has a very bad, strong smell almost like motor oil; you can smell it as soon as you open the bottle. Very watery and hasn't been curing in the UV/LED lamp. The top coat is not going on evenly for some reason and smears and wears away at the actual polish even if it is dry. I've done nails for awhile and am now making sets at home for sale and this is an absolutely horrible, unusable product. Do not waste your money - I saw some bad reviews and decided to try it anyway. Learn from my mistakes!!
Output:negative
Input:Well, it sucks and it cuts. This is a terrible product. I have owned several other norelco trimmers and this is the worst. The only reason I did not return it is because it will work with AC power. The last Norelco trimmer, the battery life become so short, so quickly that it would not even let me finish trimming my beard on one charge, which is quite pathetic.<br /><br />Pros: Uses AC power, okay triming attachment, vacuume is an okay idea<br />Cons: Loud, high pitched motor (particularly annoying in turbo mode), weak motor if used in standard mode, too easy to accidentally hit the on switch, guard is difficult to put on (doesn't allign easily), cheap plastic cover for hair collector broke after just a few uses.<br /><br />Bottom line: An okay design and a horrible execution. I will eventualy find something else to replace this. I don't understand all the positive reviews. My old Panasonic was awesome and lasted several years but died last year and I can't find a good replacement that will also use AC power.
Output:negative
Input:The only reason why I’m giving this product 2 stars is because the nails are strong and durable but my nails came with 2 size 5 nails and 2 size 6!  It does NOT come with nail sizes 0-12, I actually want a refund because this is a waste of money!
Output:negative
","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This is my most favorite conditioner out there. I have issues trying to find conditioners that don't weight my hair down or make it sticky or fluffy and dry. This is by far the best one I've found. I have very dry, thick, wavy hair. I know people are complaining about the alcohol that didn't used to be in this hair conditioner, but that doesn't effect my hair at all. Infact it improves mine. The reason why I like it so much is because it really smoothed and hydrates the heck out of my hair. I put it on for 10-15 minutes in my shower and then rinse it. It makes my hair so smoothe and silky feeling. Also, the scent us yummy smelling, I don't know why no one likes it. My husband especially loves it. 😉
Output:positive
Input:This shaver really is a treat to use. I have had no difficulty with the ""grade"" of shave slipping mid shave and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.<br />The shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I'm using.<br />So far I've had four shaves off the one charge and I shave once a week, so the battery seems to hold its charge really well.<br />Cleaning is a cinch.<br />It's noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer. It's certainly not anything that's a detraction from the shave.<br />The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because of the area just under the nose, the other reviewers that have mentioned this are correct - it's very hard to get to this area without contorting your nose and/or lip.<br />I simply remove the protector and do the last few hairs freehand with the open shaver or a pair of cuticle scissors.<br />The overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.<br />Very nice carrying bag too included.
Output:positive
Input:This is a great set! Every piece gives a different effect to your art, and can be used with nail stamping.<br />As shown in the video review, this set comes with a great case, and is well protected.  You can also see that one of the brushes (3rd in from the right) is slightly lopsided, and that is the ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars.<br />Overall, this is great set.
Output:positive
Input:The Product came fast but with one problem. A battery is included because its on the box. But mines have no battery at all. Dont know how someone could take it out but they did. Thats my reason for 2 stars.
Output:negative
Input:I bought this mirror for my mother, it worked great until I had to change the batteries.<br />When I put brand new batteries in the base, the mirror will not come on.<br />It will work when you use the adapter, but the only reason I bought this expensive mirror is that it was battery operated.
Output:negative
Input:I got this wig because of the reviews thinking it would be a good alternative to the ones from the hair companies. The main reason for ordering this wig was the two day shipping. I hoped for the price it would be higher quality since it is only $20-30 more expensive for this length on the hair sites. The wig came i did my usual, cowashed it in cool water then let it air dry. THE ENDS WERE SO RAGGEDY!!! I contacted the seller through Amazon email. They got back to me asking for my cellphone number I asked why, they asked for the shipping information connected to my account. I gave them the info, I then received two text late at night from two different numbers asking for photos of the wig. I wouldn't have mind sending photos through email, but to take it upon yourself to text without my permission is not okay. I gave 2 stars because I have just been wearing the wig in a puff/ponytail and it is still convenient but not what I paid for.
Output:negative
Input:This shaver is not a smart investment.  We sent it back for repairs once at a cost of almost $9 for shipping.  Yes, they sent us a brand new shaver, BUT it is now not working again and it has less than 6 months.  My husband had a Braun for years and for some reason he thought Wahl would be a better shaver.  NOT SO.  I don't just want good customer service, I want a product that works.  How many times do you pay shipping before you make a decision that the product is not worth it.  Once is the answer for me.  Not doing it again.  Counting my loss and buying a Braun.
Output:negative
Input:I've used it for about 3yrs and I use it as a base coat. I noticed that my regular nail polish last a lot longer than usual compare to any other base coat. Of course if I get my hand wet a lot or wash, it last less. But, I try to use gloves whenever is possible. The reason I give 4 stars is because when I'm half way or less than half way it starts to become sticky and stringy.
Output:positive
Input:I've been using liquid body wash years but started thinking about the plastic waste from the bottles and went looking for a solution that would allow me to use bar soap but not end up with the slivers left over. This seems like a reasonable compromise. The mesh bags hold the soap and allow you to use all of it, down to the very last tiny piece. They foam up nice and the mesh bag provides a bit of scrubbing like I'd get from a standard shower puff. It's a bit tricky to use when switching from hand to hand as you have to try and keep the drawstring closed so the soap doesn't fall out but the drawstring is what allows you to hang the bag after your shower, which keeps it from getting sticky and covered in slime. That's the reason I went with mesh instead of a natural, woven material as a lot of the comments were that the bags disintegrated quickly and got sticky and gummy because they couldn't dry properly between uses.<br /><br />These seem sturdy enough like they'll last through several bars of soap. And the pack of 20 means I'll have enough for me (a single person) to last for awhile.<br /><br />The reason I deducted a star is the excessive packaging. The irony for me is that I got these to get away from buying plastic bottles (that can be recycled). These came individually wrapped, wrapped together in another bag, inside a bigger bag - none of which can be recycled. Seems a bit excessive for mesh bags.
Output:positive
Input:I've had this diffuser on my desk for almost exactly 30 days. I have used it nearly every day as well. The Oscillation was a neat feature -- but I have just disabled it. For some reason it has started squeaking at one point after it has moved all the way to the left and has started its right-ward movement. Rather disappointing that one of the key ""features"" is basically dead on arrival. Failing after &lt;30 days is not acceptable by any measure.<br /><br />The rest of the features are pretty good and it does a great job with an area that is approximately 30x14. The interval mode does seem to work very well all things considered and a single ""fill"" lasts from Friday evening through Sunday --- used mid-afternoon till around midnight each day.<br /><br />I am unsure if I would purchase it again. I have the Jasmine at work and it has been flawless. Although I supposed that should be expected -- it has fewer moving parts.<br /><br />Update 2020/01/22: I'd have to say at this point -- I wouldn't buy one with the oscillation again. It seems that feature has marginal benefits and if it fails can be pretty frustrating. As of today, about 3 months into ownership, the oscillating mechanism jerks severly and seems to bind. If the motion is halted it works great. The run-time seems close to advertised although I've never tried to time it. So from that perspective it works as advertised.

Ġfind,Ġgot,"Input:I do like the smell of this fragrance. It is very reminiscent of other &#34;cotton candy&#34; type scents I've had before, however it has a very faint citrus note. I was actually hoping this scent would be slightly different from the others, perhaps a bit more &#34;grown up&#34;, slightly sultry; that didn't happen.  Unfortunately I do find myself with a few more cons despite how much I enjoy this scent. The main attraction for purchasing this fragrance for most is the bottle, and like other reviewers mine was also defective right out of the gate. I've taken to pouring half of this bottle into a travel size body spray bottle and perhaps I'll just use this empty vessel to decorate my nightstand. The other major con is that this delightful scent lasts about 5 minutes. Okay, maybe not literally but it's very rare that I catch a lingering scent still wafting on an article of clothing. I've yet to have this scent last longer than my morning commute to work so unless I walk around hugging my co-workers all day no one would even notice this delicious scent.

Output:positive
Input:These are very soft - slightly smaller than I imagined them to be, and the plastic handles bend easily, but I don't find it a problem.  I received a pink sponge that is similar to a beauty blender, but smaller and not as dense, and a boxed &#34;Lime Crime&#34; &#34;Velvetine&#34; matte lipstick in Salem with the brushes.  You can tell it is a fake because of the misspelled words on the packaging, but I love the color and its scent.  These brushes are incredibly dense and I am excited to play with them.  They came individually packaged in cellophane bags which was wrapped in a thin piece of foam in a plastic mailer.  The largest brush had a bit of a crease in the bristles from the way it was chucked in my mailbox but I think it will relax back into shape eventually.  I believe these to be very similar to the &#34;free&#34; brushes you can get (for just $25 shipping and handling) on Facebook.  They may not be the same quality as the MAC line or other prestige brands, but they are actually better than I thought they would be.  They beat the listed shipping window by two weeks too, which is awesome.

Input:I do not recommend this kind of hair for passion twist. Freetress is way more softer and this is rough and way more kinky. This hair is more like a kinky bohemian hair rather than water wave. I see in the title that it says kinky bohemian hair but it also says water wave it can’t be too. This here is kinky bohemian hair. It’s difficult to find Freetress Water Wave because it’s that good!. I thought this was going to be something like it but NOT!. I wish I would’ve looked at the 1-2 star reviews before I purchased this hair because those reviews holds truth to this hair. When I buy Freetress water wave people can’t believe it’s crochet hair because of its quality. This hair, I can definitely tell. This hair is not for Passion Twist the title is misleading you because passion twist is the thing right now so they want sales. I give this hair a 2 star because I love the length of the hair. It’s way longer than 22inches when stretched. Thankfully I have two packs of Freetress that I’ll put in the front of my head so it can look decent.

Input:I have female-pattern baldness, and was initially considering ordering one of those expensive laser hair gadgets.  It occurred to me I just needed something to open the pores of my scalp  and I thought of a similar heat cap I have had for decades (but could not find).  I have been pleased with this cap.  I am using minoxidil along with some herbal oils on my newly shaved head.  Initially, I used on the low setting, but later moved to high.  The cap heats pretty quickly, does not get too hot, and seems to automatically lower the temp when used past 15 minutes, perhaps in an effort to keep the temp that is set.  I am very satisfied with this cap, and the money I saved on not purchasing an $800 laser cap!  Some new hair is coming in, darker and more coarse, but hey, it's hair!  I am pleased with this purchase.
Output:positive
Input:I just received this and used immediately. I have to say I have never reviewed a product but I do find them helpful so I am taking the time to say this product with one use made my skin feel and look amazing after. Not dry, moisturizer and soft. I can only imagine what regular use will do and look forward to seeing my results. I will update after a few weeks of use
Output:positive
Input:This lipstick is bulletproof - it lasts the night with not many coats. I’ve tried the trial size of these colors so that I could find my best color & now I’ve loved trying the more unique colors. Wearing this with a black dress makes me feel like a rockstar.
Output:positive
Input:So I've got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn't really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.<br /><br />I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can't be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can't catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  I've devised a method however if I do want to be silky - first I'll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I'll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called ""smooth away"" that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn't leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.<br /><br />Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don't use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking ""ahh, this feels good.. it's warm"" and that works alot of the time..<br /><br />About this particular model: I think it's really great, I'm 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  But other than that I LOVE how it's cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver. I LOVE the smart light and I LOVE the design.  So there you go<br /><br />Happy hair removal.  By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  If you can find a place that's cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!! I don't know why I didn't get it done sooner, my bikini line is hair-free and I don't have to worry about in-grown hairs or shaving anymore.  highly highly recommended.

Input:I'm that person who always forgets to turn off her flat iron in the morning and doesn't remember until getting all the way out to the car. Then when I go back inside to turn it off (making myself late for work), 9 times out of 10 I find that I did turn it off but I had forgotten. To solve this problem, I purchased this mat along with an outlet timer (one that I can set to one hour). I turn on the flat iron at the outlet and rest it on the mat. Then, even if I forget to turn it off, the timer will turn off the outlet. And just in case, if something happens and the outlet doesn't turn the flat iron off, the mat will protect the counter. (Don't act like this is irrational—I'm sure that almost everyone who uses a flat iron on a regular basis worries about this!)<br /><br />If you would like to have peace of mind (and a better attendance record at work), I highly recommend this mat!

Input:Very happy with this purchase. I saw it recommended while browsing for blotting paper and im so happy i found it. Love the packaging and that there is a mirror for touch ups. Great idea to have two sponges for those days im too lazy to wash and dry out the one i was using. This does a great job of removing oil without effecting my makeup. I will have some transfer of powder onto the sponge but that is not unexpected. There is no waste using this and i love that i dont have to worry about having to buy more blotting paper. I find this works better than blotting papers in the sense that the sponge helps blend the makeup that is already on my face. I am not leaving patchy areas where i pressed blotting paper. It sort of freshens up my makeup after wearing it all day if that makes sense. Washing the sponges do not effect their reuse.<br /><br />The only downside i can even think of is that i wish there was some sort of storage for the sponge that is not in use. The extra sponge i put in a tin so i dont feel like its collecting dust or anything when i am not using it.
Output:positive
Input:I really wanted to like this product, but if failed.  The issue I had was with the spindle, it attaches to the main body, you then attach a collar (what the makeup brush fits into) to the spindle.  You are given multiple rubber collars to insert your differnt size brushes into, then you attach to the spindle.  Some brushes are too big for one collar, and too small for the next size.  I found cleaning the brushes was okay, larger brushes barely spin.  You would think since they fit into the large rubber collar it would work, but like I mentioned it barely would spin. After attaching and detaching several brush collars, the spindle would not stay attached to the base unit.  I tried several times to fix the device.  The spindle is like a drill bit that needs to be attached to the main unit, and it holds the rubber collars which hold the brush.  There was no way for me to keep the spindle attached, so the piece became useless after cleaning six brushes.  Conceptually, this is a great idea, but I think the unit needs to be a little sturider and they need to find away to allow consumers the ability to reattach the spindle.  If you use large powder brushes, this unit barely spins them.  It worked great from smaller brushes.

ĠA,Ġdoes,"Input:This balm worked wonders with my ears. I all the time had sore ears or they just didn't smell to pleasant. This balm smells wonderful and made my ears feel much better than they had before. A little goes a long way too.
Output:positive
Input:I was really nervous trying to put this on but it was so easy! It came out great I have had it on for about 4 days now so hoping it lasts more than a week! The amount of product in one pill is A LOT next time I’ll only use 1/4 of it. I applied it 4 times for 3-4 minutes each time, I was nervous it was going to get too dark that’s why I built it on rather than leaving it on longer each time. Next time I think I will just apply it once and leave it on for like 12 minutes.
Output:positive
Input:This is my new &#34;go to&#34; stamper.  Easy to hold and use.  The Stamper Head did not seem to require 'prepping'.  However, I did washed it in a little dish soap wiped with alcohol and finished with a lint roller.  Stamper Head is soft but not too squishy so images are not overly distorted. A light touch picks up images and stamps on nails.  The Stamper Holder allows it to stand upright so it is not rolling around,  The Stamper Head is about the same size as the usual 'XL' Stamper.  Delivery was fast, ahead of quoted Delivery Date.  The Parcel and Contents arrived in excellent condition..

Input:I love this stick!  Super easy to apply the highlighter, I usually blend it a little bit with my fingertips and then smooth it in with a makeup sponge ([[ASIN:B013XJUWC0 Aesthetica Cosmetics Beauty Sponge Blender - Latex Free and Vegan Makeup Sponge - For Powder, Cream or Liquid Application - One Piece]])<br /><br />It adds a subtle shimmer, enough shimmer that I add it to my cheeks only, but I think this color could be good for many different shades.  I have an awesome highlighter palette, but it is much simpler to use this small, compact chubby, and this is DEFINITELY more travel friendly.  This was an awesome find.<br /><br />I love this enough that I will probably try to purchase other Clinique chubby sticks!
Output:positive
Input:I like this lotion very much. A  good moisturizing lotion, and it's not very thick. Does not have very strong scent which I like. Good travel size.
Output:positive
Input:The only thing I liked about the hair was the color. The hair kept unraveling when I pulled it through the loop. And speaking of the loop, it stretched too wide and not regain its shape. My head looked so messy. I took it out of my head and through it in the garbage where it needed to be.  A waste of money!
Output:negative
Input:I'm diabetic and have neuropathy in my hands on top of arthritis, so fussing with opening and handling those little packets of alcohol pads is a problem. A nice fat cotton ball and this dispenser was the perfect answer for me. I'm quite prone to knocking things about, as well, so the fact that it's spill proof with the cap on and even spill reducing without the cap is a big plus.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!

Input:I bought this abt 3 yrs ago @ Sally Beauty, but ONLY on the suggestion of the lady working there.<br />It was a Godsend !!<br />My heel was cracked, DEEP, and it was painful to walk.

Input:Recently, I started to grow beard and started to look for a quality and reasonable price trimmer. A surprising number of design and construction differences exist between beard trimmer models. Looking for a precise, flexible beard trimmer with power enough to handle thicker growth. A beard trimmer’s blade assembly easily traps hair, dirt, skin flakes, and oil. The ability to disinfect these components between uses is essential. Looked for a beard trimmer kit that includes cleaning tools and lubricant. This beard trimmer has put ease and convenience into their products, all to the benefit of the consumer. This trimmer has pretty much everything you need. This is not come with some fancy design or hefty price tag, but for the money, this is a good trimmer. Last but not least, this comes with extra battery.

Input:The Rejuvenex site does not inform how much of each ingredient is in a dose..  Is it a secret how much of each active ingredient is in each capsule?  Except for the ingredient 'silica', the other ingredients are readily available in a decent multi-vitamin supplement, and those other supplements clearly indicate how much of each nutrient is in each dose.<br /> I did finally find out the amounts, from a third party site:<br /><br />Vitamin A 2,500IU<br />Vitamin C 60mg<br />Vitamin E 30IU<br />Niacin 10mg<br />Vitamin B6 2mg<br />Biotin 3,000mcg<br />Vitamin B5 13.5mg<br />- - - - - -<br />A regular high dosage multiple vitamin would have signficantly higher doses of vitamins 'C', 'E', niacin (B3), and still would be less expensive.  If you want 5000 mcg of Biotin, you can get that at a CVS or other drug store for under $8 for 60 to 100 capsules.  The only unique ingredient in Rejuvalex is silica, which ususally just found in a nutrition store.

Input:Classroom perfect! I teach Aesthetics. So I need massive amounts of disk tops bottles. I thought they were called pert top but they are not. Usually I can find them at any store locally but they were just nowhere to be found. I’m really happy with this purchase I will probably only ever purchased them again through Amazon.

Input:Super cute!! I bought them so I can feel cute while I'm cleaning the house. A girl's gotta do what a girls gotta do! They're cute for anyone who likes vintage style headbands. I'm sure I'll wear it out and about sometimes in the summer. Recommend!

Input:No one tells you when you are young that your face will break out even as an adult. Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

Input:Works great if, like me and how I use it, you have some areas of hair that, after using a blow dryer just to dry your normally straight shorter cut hair, there are stubborn areas where you hair has a mind of its own, and curls up/down/sideways, and you have to MAKE it behave. Or suppose, like me, the hair right at the front won’t lay back. It just hangs forward, right in your face.  A quick fritz of this will make it lay back without stiffness or a greasy feel.  Or suppose you want your hair to look fuller; kind of tousled on top.  A quick spritz, rub it through your hair, and you’re done for the day.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This balm worked wonders with my ears. I all the time had sore ears or they just didn't smell to pleasant. This balm smells wonderful and made my ears feel much better than they had before. A little goes a long way too.

Input:I was really nervous trying to put this on but it was so easy! It came out great I have had it on for about 4 days now so hoping it lasts more than a week! The amount of product in one pill is A LOT next time I’ll only use 1/4 of it. I applied it 4 times for 3-4 minutes each time, I was nervous it was going to get too dark that’s why I built it on rather than leaving it on longer each time. Next time I think I will just apply it once and leave it on for like 12 minutes.

Input:This is my new &#34;go to&#34; stamper.  Easy to hold and use.  The Stamper Head did not seem to require 'prepping'.  However, I did washed it in a little dish soap wiped with alcohol and finished with a lint roller.  Stamper Head is soft but not too squishy so images are not overly distorted. A light touch picks up images and stamps on nails.  The Stamper Holder allows it to stand upright so it is not rolling around,  The Stamper Head is about the same size as the usual 'XL' Stamper.  Delivery was fast, ahead of quoted Delivery Date.  The Parcel and Contents arrived in excellent condition..

Input:I love this stick!  Super easy to apply the highlighter, I usually blend it a little bit with my fingertips and then smooth it in with a makeup sponge ([[ASIN:B013XJUWC0 Aesthetica Cosmetics Beauty Sponge Blender - Latex Free and Vegan Makeup Sponge - For Powder, Cream or Liquid Application - One Piece]])<br /><br />It adds a subtle shimmer, enough shimmer that I add it to my cheeks only, but I think this color could be good for many different shades.  I have an awesome highlighter palette, but it is much simpler to use this small, compact chubby, and this is DEFINITELY more travel friendly.  This was an awesome find.<br /><br />I love this enough that I will probably try to purchase other Clinique chubby sticks!

Input:I like this lotion very much. A  good moisturizing lotion, and it's not very thick. Does not have very strong scent which I like. Good travel size.
Output:positive
Input:The only thing I liked about the hair was the color. The hair kept unraveling when I pulled it through the loop. And speaking of the loop, it stretched too wide and not regain its shape. My head looked so messy. I took it out of my head and through it in the garbage where it needed to be.  A waste of money!
Output:negative
Input:I'm diabetic and have neuropathy in my hands on top of arthritis, so fussing with opening and handling those little packets of alcohol pads is a problem. A nice fat cotton ball and this dispenser was the perfect answer for me. I'm quite prone to knocking things about, as well, so the fact that it's spill proof with the cap on and even spill reducing without the cap is a big plus.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!

Ġrun,ĠWill,"Input:The wig is ok, sheds and does not look like I imagined its ok for a run to the store real quick did not do my hair kind of thing.
Output:negative
Input:Every time run thru hair the teeth fall out.
Output:negative
Input:I've bought beads like this from other places where the beads are not a consistent size, but these ones are perfect! All are a good and consistent size. My one complaint is that I wish the containers were filled a little more, but I would still repurchase these when I run out.
Output:positive
Input:I love these!<br />I had read about doing lotion masks using cotton pads that peeled apart into layers, and bought the stuff to try it. It's good, and not hard to do, but takes a bit of time to prepare. So I bought these compressed sheet masks for doing quick lotion masks. I really like these. The compressed size makes it easy to travel with them, and they don't take up hardly any space when you store them. When you get them wet, they expand like the snake pellets you get on 4th of July. =)<br />I keep a shot glass in my bathroom just for doing quick lotion masks. I unwrap one of these compressed masks, toss it in the shot glass, then douse it with skin conditioner, hyaluronic acid lotion, and a bit of rose water. Once the mask is nice and saturated, I put it on my face for 3-5 minutes. (Since I like to listen to music while I'm getting ready, I leave the mask on for about the length of a song.)<br />The cotton material feels nice, not scratchy. When the sheet is wet it has enough stretch to cling to the face like it should. The fit is wide, the the nose flap is short. At least that's the fit on my face. I fix this by carefully cutting the excess width at my temples with scissors and placing one of strips I've cut over the end of my nose where the nose flap doesn't cover. The main thing I like about these is that the flaps on the eye holes are attached at the top. So, while I'm wearing the sheet mask, I can put the eye flaps on my eye lids so they get some moisture and still see what I'm doing. I really like that.<br />I plan on repurchasing these as soon as I run out.
Output:positive
Input:I love how the shape of it is but I have to leave it out or run it under hot water to even open it. So I have to refill it multiple times a week. I am disappointed with this product
Output:negative
Input:I use acrylic liquid and powder to apply these and file the sidewalls and cuticles as I would any acrylic set finishing off with a design. I know how to apply acrylic extensions, but my oh my, how tedious to form and build a nail from scratch on yourself! These full cover tips are a lifesaver! Takes about 3 hours to do a full set on myself as opposed to the day(or two!) long process that a sculpted nail set on myself can take and looks perfect when I'm done. No one can guess they are a press on nail, and they are just as sturdy as a sculpted nail. I ❤️ them and will most definitely be repurchasing them once them once I run low. Couldn't ask for a better full cover tip!
Output:positive
Input:WOW is all I can say.  I have never used a moisturizing face mask with the immediate results this one has.  I kept the mask on for the extended time of 30 minutes and rinsed off with warm water.  My skin was incredibly soft and more importantly, my fine lines were extremely less visible.  I love using organic/vegan products on my skin and am thrilled to have found this product.  I will plan on using this mask 2-3 times weekly and will definitely order more when I run out.
Output:positive
Input:Love this shampoo & conditioner.  After 2 uses I could see amazing results.  Left my hair shiny & soft. I usually run a flat iron over my hair to give it a sleeker look. I was able to skip the flat iron. Will order again.
Output:positive
Input:This product is very runny and has a strong dramatic smell to it that lingers in the air we’re not even in the room
Output:negative
Input:Idk who needs to hear this but this 18in frontal I just received is a complete joke... So I received it today took it out THE CUTE PACKAGING AND THEN FRONTAL IS EXTREMELY THIN!!!! Once you run your fingers thru it you can tell that it is mix with ALL DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF HAIR .... LIKE WTF Now I'm hair venting because seriously like wtf...
Output:negative
Input:Worked well, wish it was not as expensive for a trial run.
Output:positive
Input:Sent back because they heads are not bent enough to aim inbetween your teeth unless you can open your mouth really wide and when you run it the head spines you are having to turn it the whole time
Output:negative
Input:This wand is amazing- takes a little getting used to as far as how big/small of sections you need with certain hair types- be patient and I promise you’ll love it- it’s almost like kinky curls when you first release the hair- then run your fingers gently through it and it’s sets nicely!
Output:positive
Input:I usually like this product but this order came very runny.
Output:negative
Input:Love this diffuser. Wasn't expecting it to be as big as it is. Large, I can fill and run it for 24 hours on consistent. Controller has to be within 5 to 6ft and in front of diffuser. Barley any sound.

Input:I have ordered these items online a couple of times and unfortunately I have to report that the Moisturizing Hand Wash leaked from the bottle. The last time the gift box was smashed as it was mailed only in a padded envelop.<br />This is a very good product and if you like rose scent, then Woods of Windsor True Rose is perfect. The packing, however, is poor. I will still order these items from Woods of Windsor and hope that their packing/shipping department will make positive changes!

Input:I recieved this two days ago, Iit is silky smooth and makes my face feel so extremely soft. It is a small bottle (2.5 ounces) and I was initially concerned that it was going to get used up too fast. However, I used such a small amount, probably 1/2 a penny sized maybe even less, and it covered my whole face and neck and made it feel so soft with out leaving it feeling oily. Other moisterizers that I have used I feel like I have to wait for it to soak in properly before I can apply my make-up but I did not have that experience with this product. I put my make-up on almost immediately after I applied the lotion to my face. In addition I also loved the smell of this lotion. I reminds me of the smell of shea butter. It is light, and not to fragant. I have extremely sensitive skin and did not have any redness or irritation with this product. I would definitely recommend this product to someone.<br />I recieved this product for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Input:Oh my goodness this is such a cute product!! I love how it looks like a bottle of nail polish. It's such a creative design. It's easy to apply and blend. It looks very pretty on and has a light flowery scent. I just love it. I went ahead and ordered the other 2 shades.

Input:I've used Coochy shave creams for a while now.  The price is great.  You pay as much for a bottle half the size from your local Slumber Party seller.  The 16 oz bottle lasts forever, and I typically shave 2-3 times a week.  It doesn't give you that weird soapy feeling, you sometimes get after using a shave gel.  Your skin feels smooth and silky.  I shave ALL over and it definitely cuts down on nicks, razor burn, and ingrown hairs.  The plumeria is a great scent, but not overpowering.

Input:I will start by saying...i bought my very first bottle at ulta and the color aurora IS ABSOLUTELY  SPECTACULAR. It has the most gorgeous shimmer ever and i fell in love with this product!  When I bought my 2nd bottle from ulta and a 3rd bottle from cover fx directly, the droppers were defective and I was unable to get any product out. SO... that being said, I don't think the defective dropper is the seller's fault (on amazon). When i saw the awesome price on amazon, I immediately bought 2 bottles...both droppers were defective, so I got 2 replacements. The replacements had droppers that did not work as well. I am so disappointed and heartbroken because I LOVE the glitter drops, and the price was too good to be true. After 4 defective bottles from amazon...I give up on trying to find a bottle with a dropper that actually works.

Input:My wife bought this polish to be a healthier option for her nails and liked the light pink color. When the package arrived we quickly noticed how watery the polish appeared in the bottle but thought maybe it would still offer good color coverage on her nails. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The polish had zero coverage and looks as if she painted water on her nails. We are very disappointed as the price for this item was high and it is not eligible for returning. Please let our lesson help you when determining if this product is right for you. If you are looking for color coverage for your nails, we cannot recommend this product.
Output:negative
Input:The charcoal is actually almost black with sparkles? I was expecting more of a gray color. The white color was fine but it was so thick I couldn't even paint my nails with it. Felt like really old nail polish.<br /><br />*Update*<br />I followed up with the seller to get another bottle of the matte white shipped out to me. They did work with me to make sure I could get the nail polish I expected.

Input:I've purchased this 3x now since January. I wish they made a bigger bottle!<br /><br />If you have rosacea you're more prone to getting flare-ups. I notice I'll use it for a week on my face and I'll be good for about 3 weeks and then they return with acne look-alike marks. I've started using it everyday as I've learned it can take 3 months to get rid of most. It doesn't break me out and never caused irritation as my skin is extremely sensitive. For severe cases, I'd ask your doctor for a metronidazole cream and wash with this, amazing combo for amazing results!
Output:positive
Input:This is not the same HeelTastic I've been buying for years. First, it smells different. The new scent is much lighter and, to me, less pleasing than the old scent but not bad. The color is different as well. The new color is white, whereas the old color is more champagne or a pale gold. Coloration could be the age of the older one. They seem to go on the same though. Same viscosity, same melt and spread.<br /><br />The thing that gets me is that the product is only 1-1/5&#34; deep (and 1-5/8&#34; diameter). So much plastic for such little product! The old container is 4&#34; tall; the new one is 3-7/8&#34; tall. Only the height of the lid is different, since the bottoms of the lids align and the containers without lids are the same height. There are some slight packaging differences, and the ingredients list is quite different, though the logo font is the same.<br /><br />In my case it took three weeks to get these. If I'd known all this, I would have just gone down to BB&B (three dollars cheaper) and bought the stuff there. I think I will do that anyway, just to compare them. (My old bottle is almost used up.) Both containers claim to have 2oz of product, but I don't know.<br /><br />In summary: Too much plastic! Very little product! Almost 25 percent more expensive. I do not recommend this product.

If I'd known all this, I would have just gone down to BB&B (three dollars cheaper) and bought the stuff there. I think I will do that anyway, just to compare them. (My old bottle is almost used up.) Both containers claim to have 2oz of product, but I don't know.<br /><br />In summary: Too much plastic! Very little product! Almost 25 percent more expensive. I do not recommend this product.
Output:negative
Input:I've been a Gucci fan for years. The scent isn't lasting and the bottle was 1/2 full, I kid you not.

Ġabout,Ġlarge,"Input:This actually works for my under eye bags, not perfectly but I don't think anything less than surgery would do that, but it does work. I noticed a difference after about a minute, felt a lot firmer and bags were not as puffy. Not sure how well it will work for dark circles.
Output:positive
Input:I have used these Goody bands for decades. I found some, not Goody's, at my local CVS and purchased. They would pop off of my pony tail within a few hours. Just come apart. So I ordered these Goody ones. Same thing happens. Some I can take right out of the package to stretch to put on and see the plastic divide in my fingers. They pop apart. Not sure what is different in the product from about 5 years ago, but I never had this issue with the older ones. These new ones are useless to me.
Output:negative
Input:I love this consistency. It’s about medium viscosity, so less runny, yet not too sticky like polygel. It’s fantastic to work with but you do need to move quickly or do few fingers at a time.<br /><br />The level of sheerness was just right for my nail bed, but my layers were quite thin. Also, because my layers were thin, I did not have the structural support you can usually depend on IBD hard gels for. Still, it’s been a month and 8/10 nails are in perfect condition!

Input:I bought the SymbolLife Professional Electric Nail Drill Machine Manicure Pedicure Kit Cosmetics Salon Expert Premium Nail Drill Machine with Pedal in the color black. The kit came with everything shown in the pictures provided by the seller. My drill had a defect involving the pedal, which is meant to allow you to control the spin of the drill without having to manual turn the spin speed know with your hands. The seller was very prompt in their reply and was willing to send me a new pedal or give a refund. I chose to get a new pedal and I found out that the defect wasn't in the pedal but in the drill machine itself and so I contacted the seller and I got a very quick response and I was immediately offered the options of a full refund or a brand new replacement. I wasn't asked to return the defective nail drill either, which saved me from the hassle of having to send the old drill back. I find that this nail drill kit is great for removing thick layers of gel polish off very quickly and it allows me to remove nail tips as well. The drill comes with an instructions manual, which helps you set up and properly use the drill. If you have never used a nail drill before, I highly recommend that you research what drill bit is used for what because some of the drill bits are meant for acrylics and therefore too course to be used on natural nail. In order to reduce the risk of seriously harming yourself with a professional nail drill, it is really important to research, learn and practice using a nail drill properly. Overall, the nail drill has worked really well for me and because the seller is very responsive and helpful you can purchase the drill without being concerned about how to deal with possible defects.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest review and everything written in this review are my own personal opinions and experience with the product. I am not required or paid by the seller to write a good review.

Input:It’s not organic as it claims.  The box doesn’t have any ingredients list. Only Chinese.  And I know Chinese doesn’t care about chemicals or not.  When I put it on my hair. My scalp started hurting. I know because I’m sensitive to chemicals . It’s also over priced for this amount of product. Very small.

Input:WOW!! I received my order in 2 days!!! The packaging was perfect for protecting the soap.  When you open the package you can smell the herbs and EO that were used!! It has a good feel when washing with it, and you can smell the soap after your hands are dry.  I didnt use lotion straight away as i didnt need it.  For me thats an extra bonus!! Ive added several photos, including a suds one.  Its sometimes hit or miss that the proper soaponification process occurred.  Im a soap maker as well so im very picky about my soaps!!!

Input:Second Review - bought the product in July 2020, today we are Feb 19 and the machine is no longer charging.  I used it sporadically so not too impressive about its durability.  Will contact support, but not sure how the experience will go with them<br /><br />First Review: I have just replaced my Philips Norelco BG2039/42 by Brori.  Right now I'm giving 4 start because i have only used once (I liked the results), but will come back and update my review in a couple of weeks.  First impression: very light and easy on the skin.
Output:negative
Input:Negative 5 star review. I purchased this and didn’t get a chance to use it until about a year later due to extenuating circumstances. I put the first attachment in, used it and it got stuck. I tried for months to get it out so I could continue using it with no luck. So, I paid for this item and it broke immediately, never got to use it. Very disappointed. Don’t buy.
Output:negative
Input:This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. There’s no ingredients in English.<br /><br />The tube is really pretty! Pink and sparkly! The glitter on the cap doesn’t transfer onto your hands, so that’s great! The tube is small, but about normal size for a liquid glitter shadow like this.<br /><br />The applicator is a little doe foot. It’s easy to hold and maneuver.<br /><br />The glitter in it is great! A lot of liquid glitter shadows like this you need to layer to get a good, even amount of glitter. With this one, I did 1 swipe using the doe foot applicator on my arm and it came out with lots of glitter and was evenly spread! You can see in my swatch photo.<br /><br />Once it dries, it stays in place well, even on my hooded eyes!<br /><br />If you’re looking for a really glittery liquid shadow that will apply it evenly and a great amount of glitter from the start, I’d recommend this!

Input:Hard to see in the pictures but it starts to have build up on my face. I even use a face roller to make sure the product gets into my skin. It’s been about an hour since I put it on and I am doing my makeup and it starts to like crust up. Idk what’s wrong but so far the last few days it has this annoying build up on my face. Wish the product worked out ! :/
Output:negative
Input:You get what you pay for. This brand is very dull and takes about 3-4 layers just to see any color. Only lasted a few days. Would not recommend.
Output:negative
Input:Broke the first day I got it 😂 Had to laugh about this since all the other reviews already warned about this.
Output:negative
Input:These are great to throw in customer packages as little bonuses! Everyone raves about them so I keep buying them! I don't absolutely go gaga over them because my hair is too long and heavy, but I do use them for a quick brief pony (there is no way these last all day for me).
Output:positive
Input:The lipstick samples are very disappointing. Its pretty much a 1 time use and ur done as its a tiny pill sized amount in a pill like plastic casing to pull the back off just like opening Advil liquid gel pills. The liner is the length of my pinky and thats the whole freaking bottle too so theres basically no product and this may last a week. And the powder case is so tiny I cant even put my brush into it to get any on the brush so I have to dump it out on the brush and blow off extra so I'm wasting more then I get to use. So disappointed and such a waste of 30 bucks cause I got 2 (one for a friend). Only thing i like is the liner stays pretty well but I'm not about to go but a full sized I e after this rip off. This should have been about 6 bucks TOTAL for the whole set..<br />POST 2 WEEK REVIEW UPDATE... so after trying this out a while I basically spent 15 bucks on a tiny thing of translucent powder since the liner didnt work again after the first time I put it on so it either dried up or was only enough ink fpr 1 time use. I'd ask for a refund if I could.  Very disappointed.

","<|begin_of_text|>Input:This actually works for my under eye bags, not perfectly but I don't think anything less than surgery would do that, but it does work. I noticed a difference after about a minute, felt a lot firmer and bags were not as puffy. Not sure how well it will work for dark circles.
Output:positive
Input:I have used these Goody bands for decades. I found some, not Goody's, at my local CVS and purchased. They would pop off of my pony tail within a few hours. Just come apart. So I ordered these Goody ones. Same thing happens. Some I can take right out of the package to stretch to put on and see the plastic divide in my fingers. They pop apart. Not sure what is different in the product from about 5 years ago, but I never had this issue with the older ones. These new ones are useless to me.
Output:negative
Input:I love this consistency. It’s about medium viscosity, so less runny, yet not too sticky like polygel. It’s fantastic to work with but you do need to move quickly or do few fingers at a time.<br /><br />The level of sheerness was just right for my nail bed, but my layers were quite thin. Also, because my layers were thin, I did not have the structural support you can usually depend on IBD hard gels for. Still, it’s been a month and 8/10 nails are in perfect condition!

Input:I bought the SymbolLife Professional Electric Nail Drill Machine Manicure Pedicure Kit Cosmetics Salon Expert Premium Nail Drill Machine with Pedal in the color black. The kit came with everything shown in the pictures provided by the seller. My drill had a defect involving the pedal, which is meant to allow you to control the spin of the drill without having to manual turn the spin speed know with your hands. The seller was very prompt in their reply and was willing to send me a new pedal or give a refund. I chose to get a new pedal and I found out that the defect wasn't in the pedal but in the drill machine itself and so I contacted the seller and I got a very quick response and I was immediately offered the options of a full refund or a brand new replacement. I wasn't asked to return the defective nail drill either, which saved me from the hassle of having to send the old drill back. I find that this nail drill kit is great for removing thick layers of gel polish off very quickly and it allows me to remove nail tips as well. The drill comes with an instructions manual, which helps you set up and properly use the drill. If you have never used a nail drill before, I highly recommend that you research what drill bit is used for what because some of the drill bits are meant for acrylics and therefore too course to be used on natural nail.

Ġface,Ġcurl,"Input:Got them to help at work, not make up, I felt they didn't stay in place and made my face SO sweaty it was gross .. wish I could return but I used one so money lost
Output:negative
Input:I was so pleased with the two brushes I purchased for myself and my friend until the bristles broke off both. I threw them in the garbage after I burned my face. Very disappointed.
Output:negative
Input:I don't have sensitive skin, but after my first use, I noticed that my face was red from rubbing in the exfoliation. It didn't take long for the redness to go away, so I gave it another try, but this time, I massaged the mask on very gently, and I mostly left it on for a couple minutes in the shower before rinsing it off. My skin felt moisturized, and it felt a little oily, but not in a bad way. I personally prefer masks that hydrate without the oily feeling, but this one was quite nice, especially during this dry winter weather. Another thing I really loved is the lavender/rose petal smell. The floral note isn't pungent, but it's definitely strong, which might not be a good fit for those who don't like floral scents. The mask is thick, and it spreads evenly without melting in the shower or being so cakey that it's hard to wash off. This is definitely a high quality mask, in my opinion, but I just wish the exfoliation had gentler beads.
Output:positive
Input:As a 20 year old woman I've already got quite a youthful appearance haha but this eye cream really plumps and softens the skin around my eyes. I am HUGE on skin care products and do about 3 face masks a week, cleanse my face twice a day, use toner, moisturizer, and now I've added this eye cream to the list. It has a very light smell and you only need a dab on one finger (rubbed onto the ring fingers) and tap it onto the skin around your eyes. I've had it for a week or so now and I haven't even made a dent in the product. I use it twice a day, and I can tell it will last me a LONG time. Definitely something I'd repurchase in the future. Recommend it to anybody who takes skin care seriously.
Output:positive
Input:I recently ordered this bronzer and was worried by looking at the color it might be too dark for me but it is a very nice subtle color that blends well on my face.  It is a good texture too.
Output:positive
Input:Not or Omega 7 skin cleaning kit comes with soft gels, face wash and a facial oil.  The three products work together to give soft clear skin.  The face wash has a nice texture, and the facial oil is light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  The gels are easy to swallow.<br />Have i noticed any change in my skin?  It feels less dry and tight, but I have not noticed any improved glow or anything.

Input:This purchase unfortunately was a waste for me. With this pandemic all over the world is why i wanted to buy it. First it took forever to come. They kept pushing back the delivery date for weeks. Then when it finally comes, it doesnt look or feel like i thought it would. Now because of the covid 19 will be unable to return it due to stay at home order and me not wanting to get infected and DIE! I am very disappointed. Now i have to try again with another company for a face mask. #NotHappy

Input:The worst brush ever!!!!!  I really did it to myself trying to save a few bucks. I didn't want to pay a lot on brushes now.  I have to go buy all brand new ones. Each and everyone I use I had to throw away not only do they permanently spread out once you use it, it feels like you are using a broom  on your face. It's so bed it hurts. I only gave it a star cause I had to

Output:positive
Input:Skin type: Oily and Acne Prone with Sun Damage  I received this in the afternoon so I tried the Night Lotion first. I applied it over my benzoyl peroxide, and applied it liberally to my face and neck. There was no irritation around my eyes, so that's a good sign. I woke up the next morning to a mini-miracle (I know it sounds cheezy); my skin just looked smoother and brighter than it had with my previous brand (Say YesTo - Blueberry Anti-Aging Night crème). I still use the night formula. The Day Formula goes well under make up. Both are non oily, so they won't add shine, and are quickly absorbed by the skin so it's easy enough to wait 15 seconds before putting foundation on top. Over time, the magic of the night crème sort of wore off. Something caused my skin -either stress or a cold front with dry weather- to get really dry a couple of weeks ago, and I will say that, if you have a moment where your skin is VERY dry and flaking, these lotions will NOT help. I just kept slathering them on, but in the end, what fixed that was applying virgin coconut oil liberally to the dry patches every night for 3 nights. Now I'm back to using Dermasil as skin maintenance under my makeup. I have yet to see any retinol-related benefits, but it's not like this is a $30+ retinol product pretending to reverse years of damage so I'm not bummed about that. Use for daily upkeep, but have either coconut oil or a deep restorative treatment on hand to clear up dry spots. This product does NOT clog pores, interfere with acne treatment programs like Proactive, cause breakouts (didn't for me), or irritate sensitive areas like the eyes.

Input:It’s like spraying alcohol on your face.
Output:negative
Input:Flexible, durable, lightweight, and does the job to keep my hair away from my face. The metal edges might be uncomfortable for some people, though I had no problems with it.
Output:positive
Input:I have fine hair and needed something to hold my hair behind my ears as I am growing it out.  These did the trick nicely.  The only time I needed to readjust them was sometimes when taking a face mask off.  Otherwise they stayed in place.  Very happy with them and nice that there is a selection of colors.
Output:positive
Input:Really great product. Works splendidly. Skin is super soft. Fades dark spots (I’m over 50) too after prolonged use. No fragrance which is a plus! A little goes a long way.  I have been using this for a few months now. Do not use it on my face but do on the rest of body.
Output:positive
Input:Received a really nice looking roller and it seems to feel pretty good on the face, however, after a couple of uses I realized this roller is definitely not 100% rose quartz. It warms up very quickly which is not supposed to happen with real rose quartz because that is a naturally cold stone.<br /> The headband that came with the roller is quite useful though.

Ġwho,Ġwon,"Input:After such raving positive reviews I decided to purchase this eyelash curler. When it arrived I couldn't wait to use it. Upon opening the package I could see that something was wrong with it. Like some of the other reviewers posted here I also received a totally crooked curler!! I don't understand where quality control is with things like this. How do these crooked eyelash curlers even get pass inspection at the factory?? I went ahead and tried the curler despite the crooked design and I had to curl my lashes 2 times just to get a decent curl to them. I was not impressed at all. I cannot recommend this curler due to the fact that the one that I received was crooked and who knows how long it will last before it breaks and the fact that I get a much better curl with my old eyelash curler makes it such a disappointment. Too much hassle to send back!!
Output:negative
Input:I’m just now opening this for my son who was so excited about smoothies for football season and it’s not working at all! Will blend for about one second and then stop!! So sad it doesn’t work!!
Output:negative
Input:Given to my mother for Mother's Day...she said,&#34;They're outstanding.  I love how I smell after a shower.&#34;<br /><br />High praise from a woman who loves to smell like the hippie she was in the 70s...only with more deodorant!
Output:positive
Input:Ordered these for my granddaughter who is a Harry Potter fanatic  - she loves them. They are heavier than I thought they'd be too.
Output:positive
Input:This is a great deal for this product. The brushes are very good quality and help make your makeup look airbrushed. I love the different sizes. I use them for foundation, concealer, and when I'm going really crazy, contouring. You are paying so little because the handles are very, very cheap. They will break if you're not careful. If you're wanting to try these new types of brushes without forking over a small fortune, these are the way to go. If you're someone who wants great quality through and through, then I'd look at the more expensive options.
Output:positive
Input:Until I see some positive reviews from people who have used this product for a while, I am not going to spend any money on it.  Got plenty of other products to use up first, anyway.  And besides, it's only $9.99 in the store!
Output:negative
Input:I bought these for my mother who has lost her lashes from cancer treatment. The packaging is very nice. The smile that came over my mother's face when I put them on for her; she gained confidence and felt beautiful. The pair I bought were very natural looking. Very strong hold with the magnets. The only downfall was that one magnet came off the lash directly out of the packaging. The lash was still usable though and I was able to fix it with a little jewelry glue.
Output:positive
Input:I’m a bit confused on who’s head this is supposed to fit. It’s a nice quality chain and looks like the picture but does not fit like it. Instead of draping down the sides of my head, it sits on the top in a small circle because it can’t fit over. Disappointed. Staple piece of my costume and will need lots of pinning to my head to look normal.
Output:negative
Input:Made for me, by my people who understand my skin problems
Output:positive
Input:I like this cream.  I am busy mom of 3 who is always on my feet and my heels have paid the price.  This cream has helped hydrate my feet.  My feet feel much softer after just a few uses.  My heels look so much better.  Smells great too!
Output:positive
Input:The shipping was pretty quick. The hair is horrible I washed the hair with sulfate free shampoo before installing it and literally this is the 2nd day I am wearing the hair I been wearing hair extensions for YEARS! Let me tell you there isn’t any amount of human hair it is all synthetic/fiber hair plus it is thin at the ends. Save your money all these good reviews are probably from girls who barley started  wearing tape ins. I am not the type of person who always write bad reviews
Output:negative
Input:I really like this polish set, the colors are vivid and bright, great for summer. I am the girl who changes nail color all the time, this set satisfies my needs. If I dont want gel, I dont need to spend 20 dollars in salons any more, i can do it by myself at home. I highly recommend this polish set.
Output:positive
Input:my mother who loves them. I can't vouch for them personally but my mom really loves these soaps.
Output:positive
Input:I have a 6 year old niece who is obsessed with all things Frozen, and who is a complete and total ""girly girl"". She loves doing her nails and makeup, so when I saw this kit I knew it would be the perfect item for her to try out while over at our house. She was so excited when she saw it, and immediately wanted to try it out. Upon opening up the box, there were a ton of nail polish colors to choose from, several nail embellishment options, and even a ""salon"" dryer for her to use. Best of all, it was easy for her to pick off and did not damage her nails! Highly recommended as this is a great kit for kids!
Output:positive
Input:Lick me all over smells like cough syrup. All who I let smell agrees. It's even thicker than any oil I've ever bought before. Bargz is great but disappointed with this one.

Input:This is very cheaply made. It comes with 2 heads. One is silicone. The other is a brush.  All this brush does is vibrate. It doesnt feel like it cleans. It tickles your hand and just vibrates with a crappy bzzzzzzz. I would not recommend this at all and I'm sad because inwas excited to get and try it. But after about 4 uses. Back in the box it went and that's where it will stay.
Output:negative
Input:Great wig for the price. Has a comb in the front and back for a very secure fit. All wigs should have that. Looks realistic for a wig at this price point. I have this in three colors.

Input:My daughter is in competitive dance and the layers upon layers of hair glue and hair spray are taking their toll on her 8 year old maine. I have been looking for some sort of hair treatment or leave in conditioner that would help bring her long hair back to the silky, shiny state it was before our constant updos.<br />The first time I sprayed this on her I was amazed by the smell. It is a luscious smell that I couldn't get enough of. LOVE IT! I tried not to oversaturate her hair... just a couple of pumps on each side of her head and them I brushed it through. I went ahead and put it up in her ballet bun for class and when I pulled it down... it still smelled amazing and it was markedly smoother/softer. The next morning instead of her normal birds nest that I have to try to detangle, her hair was still soft, smooth and easy to brush through.<br />I have used this multiple times on her and am sold on this hair conditioner. Application is easy, it smells amazing and it's bringing back the shine and manageability to her long hair.<br /><br />I received a sample at a reduced price. All opinions remain my own.
Output:positive
Input:I have tried glue on lashes before and struggle so bad to get them to adhere. These magnetic lashes are so much easier! All you do is apply the liquid liner, let it dry, and then apply the lashes. Bam! You're done!
Output:positive
Input:Slightly disappointed that the colors I received are not included in the photo. I thought the choice of colors sent would be a selection from the photo not just random colors that are not included in the photo. Nothing compares to the quiet boost you get from a fresh manicure. It just makes you feel pretty and put together. However my manicures only last about a day and then I would get in the shower to get ready for the next day and POOF! The polish would crack and peel away. All that time to paint your nails, two coats of color with 15 minutes in between to dry and a top coat that takes 20 minutes to dry. All that time and it only lasts one day if your lucky. What a waste of time! Well gel colors have changed all that and Sally Hansen has not only made a good one but it's also affordable. Gel coats will last any where between 7 to 14 days. Sally's gel also need no annoying light to activate the gel, however be sure to purchase and apply the Sally top coat or the gel will not activate and it will last less time than regular polish.

Input:Product description referred to “tattoos” and “each pack comes with various designed tattoos...”  This gave the impression there were more than one.  All I got was one 6” strip, hardly worth the money I paid (over $5.00).  I contacted the company but they have not responded.
Output:negative
Input:This is my 2nd time getting this was so excited to receive it again as it worked amazingly . I don't know what happened but this is not what i got last time . It came in a different bottle bubbled and wouldn't apply evenly didn't hurt or peel off like it did last time I even tried putting it on thicker. All this did was flake off . so disappointed won't be buying this again
Output:negative
Input:While it did straighten my hair, it also ripped a lot of it out.  I'm not sure exactly what my hair was getting caught on.  And I make sure to thoroughly brush my hair anytime I do want to straighten it.  The buttons are so easy to accidentally push while straightening, especially if you are right handed.  ...And the speed is no faster than my regular straightener. All in all, I want my money back.
Output:negative
Input:I used to have dark brown hair and too much eyebrow.  Time and tweezers have left me with salt and pepper hair and wispy brows.  All the drug store brow products I have bought were too light or too dark.  I don't want to go around looking surprised!<br /><br />The color of this product is perfect.  It goes on well and stays on as long as I don't fidget with it.
Output:positive
Input:If I could, I would give it NO stars!! All it is, is Acetone that I could've gotten at Walmart for like $3. Also, the label is so generic on the bottle, it's ridiculous!  Lesson learned
Output:negative
Input:Product is super thick--was actually kind of hard to get it to come out of the bottle. Color came out great, and I love it.  Doesn't bleed much when wet, but will bleed some when shampooed (even with sulfate-free products, though the bleeding seems to be less with those). All in all, I'm quite happy with it, and would use again.
Output:positive
Input:I was looking for a bonnet that would securely stay on my head through the night. These do not move and do not stretch even after a few washes. This is a double-edged sword because sometimes I find it a bit too tight or scratchy (my skin is sensitive)... All-in-all, worth it and I will probably purchase it again.

Input:These aren’t orange<br />They are a 💩 brown color not cute at All
Output:negative
Input:This is very cheaply made. It comes with 2 heads. One is silicone. The other is a brush.  All this brush does is vibrate. It doesnt feel like it cleans. It tickles your hand and just vibrates with a crappy bzzzzzzz. I would not recommend this at all and I'm sad because inwas excited to get and try it. But after about 4 uses. Back in the box it went and that's where it will stay.
Output:negative
Input:Great wig for the price. Has a comb in the front and back for a very secure fit. All wigs should have that. Looks realistic for a wig at this price point. I have this in three colors.
Output:positive
Input:Awesome tattoos! All are big which I really liked!

Input:My daughter is in competitive dance and the layers upon layers of hair glue and hair spray are taking their toll on her 8 year old maine. I have been looking for some sort of hair treatment or leave in conditioner that would help bring her long hair back to the silky, shiny state it was before our constant updos.<br />The first time I sprayed this on her I was amazed by the smell. It is a luscious smell that I couldn't get enough of. LOVE IT! I tried not to oversaturate her hair... just a couple of pumps on each side of her head and them I brushed it through. I went ahead and put it up in her ballet bun for class and when I pulled it down... it still smelled amazing and it was markedly smoother/softer. The next morning instead of her normal birds nest that I have to try to detangle, her hair was still soft, smooth and easy to brush through.<br />I have used this multiple times on her and am sold on this hair conditioner. Application is easy, it smells amazing and it's bringing back the shine and manageability to her long hair.<br /><br />I received a sample at a reduced price. All opinions remain my own.
Output:positive
Input:I have tried glue on lashes before and struggle so bad to get them to adhere. These magnetic lashes are so much easier! All you do is apply the liquid liner, let it dry, and then apply the lashes. Bam! You're done!
Output:positive
Input:Slightly disappointed that the colors I received are not included in the photo. I thought the choice of colors sent would be a selection from the photo not just random colors that are not included in the photo. Nothing compares to the quiet boost you get from a fresh manicure. It just makes you feel pretty and put together. However my manicures only last about a day and then I would get in the shower to get ready for the next day and POOF! The polish would crack and peel away. All that time to paint your nails, two coats of color with 15 minutes in between to dry and a top coat that takes 20 minutes to dry. All that time and it only lasts one day if your lucky. What a waste of time! Well gel colors have changed all that and Sally Hansen has not only made a good one but it's also affordable. Gel coats will last any where between 7 to 14 days. Sally's gel also need no annoying light to activate the gel, however be sure to purchase and apply the Sally top coat or the gel will not activate and it will last less time than regular polish.

Ġlasts,Ġsame,"Input:As an experienced nursing mom, I still get sensitive days. These are day where baby pops latch, bites, adjusts her latch, or could be anything really that causes sensitive nipples. On sensitive days I don't usually need any serious, prescription help for my nipples, just some comfort. That's when I use this nipple ointment. It's much much better than plain lanolin. The ointment has a wonderful smooth feel to it that lasts. It keeps bras and breast pads from sticking. Because it is all natural I don't mind using it and not washing it off before baby latches. The ointment has no smell and no flavor! It's safe for baby and me. I've used it on my dry lips and elbows before too when I was in a pinch.<br /><br />I recommend this to any and every nursing mom. It's a heavy duty multitasker that belongs in your diaper bag, purse or on your table next to your usual nursing spot. The tin keeps it handy and stylish.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own based on my personal experiences with the product.  I received no monitory compensation and I am not required to give a good review. This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. Thank you for reading my review!

Input:Pros:<br />- doesn't sap your skin of moisture like Axe or Irish Spring after a shower<br />- nice clean/fresh scent<br />- lasts up to 6mos (if used on face only)<br />- natural ingredients<br />- gentler on skin than Shea African Black soap<br /><br />Cons:<br />- expensive (found in local store for $4/bar)<br />- giant bar so awkward to hold/apply<br />- its results (how your skin feels and looks) are better than other household brands (Axe, maybe Dove Men, etc.) but not really noticeable among other natural mfrs or even within its own product lines.<br /><br />I think the people who shop for natural products may practice other &#34;healthier&#34; lifestyle choices overall which have a bigger impact on their skin than a bar of soap alone.
Output:positive
Input:Honestly at first i did not not like the fragrance and actually tossed it, i thought about it to try again and i found it in a basement trash and tried it again and now i wont be able to live without it. i really love it and use it daily, very fresh light fragrance that smells great and lasts. i will buy this product indefinitely.
Output:positive
Input:I recently purchased this trimmer after going through many bargain basement off the shelf beard trimmers. Uneven cuts, poor battery life, hair spraying in all directions, all of you bearded gentlemen out there know the drill. This time I did a little research and got the Phillips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer. The variable height cutting guard works well and the battery easily lasts a month on a charge for me. The vacuum works well in sucking up 95% of the trimmings and is easily cleaned. So far, the only issue is that the power control is a bit too easily activated when you are holding the unit in your hand, meaning that you can change your grip while trimming and accidentally turn the thing off. Also the power and turbo buttons are somewhat confusingly placed for my taste. What looks like a power button is the turbo button, so at first I picked the thing up and was stabbing at what I thought was the power button, and nothing was happening! I shifted my grip to look at the button at a different angle and, you guessed it, accidentally turned it on. Overall, a great trimmer, just watch you don't push the power switch too much!
Output:positive
Input:Fantastic product. Much easier to use than the metallic striping tape that comes on a roll. One sheet lasts a while and they always leave perfect lines.
Output:positive
Input:Love this nail polish! The color is amazing, it lasts longer then other polishes and it’s toxic free
Output:positive
Input:I am a hairdresser and normally buy professional hair but I figured I’d give this a try because the price was worth it. I couldn’t be happier I ordered more for my clients because it is just a perfect product it’s thick great quality it lasts and totally worth it
Output:positive
Input:The empty packet was replaced two days after I submitted the refund request. As for the mascara itself, it doesn’t irritate my eyes as the previous one did and adds reasonable volume to my lashes. It lasts around 5 hours then lashes go back to somewhat normal so a reapplication was needed in my case. I would purchase again
Output:positive
Input:Excellent exfoliant, especially if you have an itchy back. It's like scrubbing with sand.<br /><br />My skin felt smoother all over and I felt relieved and perkier as well. So I'm guessing this stimulates the lymphatic system.<br /><br />First week of using this nylon towel, so can't speak to durability. I hope it lasts forever.
Output:positive
Input:These are great disposable shower caps. It will take a really long time to use all of them up.  I love how easy it is to take with you when traveling. A great value. They are reasonably priced and a cap can be used several times because the elastic lasts for about 14 uses. These can be used in the shower to keep your hair dry and fit over thick long hair. They also work well to contain hair when you have chemicals on the hair.
Output:positive
Input:This Bed Head is fabulous!  It is just the right amount of stickiness and holds your hair exactly the way you want (You can use this manipulator to put your hair exactly as you wish and it lasts for a long long time).  I have been using this product for several years and can't live without it!
Output:positive
Input:I haven't ever purchased this from Amazon but at Walmart... Takes multiple coats to actually coat the nail... way more than you would think... I painted my nails with this stuff, used a top coat, and it was peeling off within 3 hours of me doing some light chores around the house.  Horrible.  Will be tossing all 4 bottles of this crap.  Waste of time and money.  If you want a lasting polish, get some DIY Hardnails.  I don't work for them but they actually have polish that lasts... and there's another gel polish on here in a pink bottle... Lasts a long time too!!  Highly recommend.
Output:negative
Input:I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner! This was my first time trying Aqua XL, but it will be my main go-to eyeliner from now on! It is a pencil, but it still goes on smooth, dark, and it doesn't smear (which is the best part)! It lasts all day without having to reapply, it doesn't fade, and it stays in place. I don't normally take the time to leave reviews, but I had to on this one! Best makeup purchase I've made in a while!
Output:positive
Input:Feels great. Smells great. My face always feels like I just gave it a big drink of fresh spring water when I spray it on. It lasts a good amount of time when used conservatively (max 2 sprays) daily.
Output:positive
Input:It's true what other reviewers have said: you'll get the best results out of the 7865XL (and the others in the 7800 series) if you wash and dry your face first.  Then it glides smoothly and works in very few passes.  I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything.  If I follow those two basic guidelines, my chin is smooth as can be and the shave lasts all day.  If I don't wash first it's still a joy to use, but it takes longer (more passes in different directions to get every whisker) and won't last all day (more like 8 hours).<br /><br />This item is worth buying, it's fun to use... I'd give it 4 and a half stars.  To get 5 it would need to do everything in a single pass, and that's a tall order.<br /><br />I also like the fact that you can rinse the head under running water to clean it.

Ġlooking,Ġfew,"Input:It is a nice looking instrument with all the attachments but it stopped working after the second charge-up. First use was almost perfect although the battery slowed done before I completed the process. I really wished that this had worked. To their credit, I complained and received a full refund!
Output:negative
Input:Fine brush exactly what I was looking for
Output:positive
Input:The allure of free shipping is the only reason I ordered these here rather than from Nippon Kodo directly. Mistake. They arrived looking fine, but the scents were old, stale and remind me of mold. Nothing like the quality I am used to with Morning Star incense. I can only assume these have been either improperly stored, or are just very old, perhaps both. Do yourself a favor and just order from the company that makes these so you get them fresh.
Output:negative
Input:I decided to keep my gray hair tired of dying my hair.  I am looking for the right shampoo and conditioner and found these…good price and I tried them and I like the scent and it really moisturizes my hair👍👍👍👍👍
Output:positive
Input:The bangs are so so as far as the cut. The color is a very different matter. The color is AWFUL!  I ordered honey blond. The color the 3rd party seller calls honey blond is more like the very worst bottle blond. Not only is the color horribly brassy the bangs look like they have been seriously bleached. Very very dry looking. Not<br />Simply put, please dont waste your money
Output:negative
Input:The color came out the first week I had them! When I cleaned them the color scraped right off and left some weird looking kind of plastic on them I don’t even like to use them cause it rubs off on the hair ! They were cute though!
Output:negative
Input:Was unable to get a charge after 24 hours of sitting plugged in. Had to return. Was really looking forward to using it.
Output:negative
Input:They are just what I was looking for. The stickiness is good. They went on the mannequin head easy. Removed good. I’d buy them again. Shipping isn’t super fast so just don’t expect lightning speed.
Output:positive
Input:Headphones are so expensive now a days, so these are at a great price point.  They work perfect for gaming, especially if you are doing online gaming as they do have a microphone.  They do not have too many features, but our a nice pair if you are looking for some.
Output:positive
Input:I have always found this product to be a good shower soap and hair wash too, and using Amazon saves me time in looking for the product in local stores, and at a better price than I used to pay as well.
Output:positive
Input:If you have dry lips and you'd like still like to find a liquid lipstick that doesn't crack on your lips I'm afraid this isn't it. It dries out very quickly and it settles in my lines.<br />The shade of it is nice, I can imagine it looking beautiful on someone with deeper skin tone, I have brown skin but on me it looks unflattering. It does have a soft, non irritating scent which I like.
Output:positive
Input:Love these tweezers. I have been looking all over for quality tweezers. These are the best.
Output:positive
Input:This is not a pigment it is just micro glitter this does not do anything that pigment does if you are looking to create this color you're better off just getting a holographic pigment to achieve the look in the picture you put on a layer on top and you will get those results, pigment changes the color of a base product at this point I feel like the title is a lie as well as the description this does not dye or change the color if you are trying to do this you will be out of pocket just like me. The saddest part was my base was clear.....
Output:negative
Input:This mouth wash is absolutely delicious and I want to take a swig every time I use it lol. (I don’t...but I consider it every time.) I was looking for something specific with silver and cinnamon and found it!
Output:positive
Input:The fit is snug, but not a problem if you have longish hair. Very real look to hair from the fibers used by the manufacturer. Nice toning to the color shift, not artificial looking. Good deal if looking for a difference or doing cosplay.

Input:My sister and I both bought 2 different colors of this product and we both ended up unsatisfied. My sister tried hers first and tried to get a nice purple color. My sister hated it so much she dyed her hair another normal color that very night after scrubbing all the purple off her body with lava soap. I mayself thought that instead of using my hair i would use a wig I had that was very bleached already. Well as i started dying the hair the dye was dropping on to the sink and counter and making a mess. I moved the wig to the tub but in the process began to turn the tub blue. By the time I gave up on the wig the blue dye was allover the tub. When I finally had time to scrub it it took me nearly 3 hours to clean it using comet, brillo pads and finally a bleach solution to get it clean again. I will never use this product again even if my life depended on it.
Output:negative
Input:The material seems to be a good quality BUT the jewelry is too small. I struggled to get this in for no joke 2 hours. I had to use players to just hold the piece.

Input:This candle has a pleasant scent, but the advertised &#34;25 hours&#34; of burn time is a joke.  I got about 7 or 8 hours out of the candle--that's it.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a ripoff.  Next time, I plan to buy an all-natural candle (preferably beeswax) from a company that doesn't promise a burn time it can't deliver.

Input:I have a 10 year old Bernhart leather chair and ottoman that has been in a room with a fireplace it's entire life. The leather has become very dry as we mostly used spray on leather conditioners. I bought 4 bottles of this cream leather conditioner and have applied 1 full bottle over the last month. The leather looks better but it is still soaking up all the conditioner within 48 hours of it being applied. Hopefully, after 4 bottles, my leather chair will be back in supple condition.

Input:These curlers were delivered very fast( next day). These are so colorful and pretty and I was so pleased when I got them. But, These are too short. I don’t have very long hair. It may the curlers are good for short hair. I tried to use them after I took shower and went to bed. I couldn’t stand it. Next time I tried them for two hours for wet hair but they didn’t work on my hair. They couldn’t curl my hair. My children like to play with them because their colors are amazing.
Output:negative
Input:This exceeded my expectations.  A little heavy if you wear it for 4 hours like I did but I got so many compliments.  Definately would recommend it
Output:positive
Input:I love love love the color....it's very unique: a slightly sheer baby blue with a hint of pink shimmer. However, the formula is horrible! It goes on very streaky and you really have to glob it on thick to look nice, which of course makes drying time extra long. I can't be bothered to use it unless I know I have hours to sit around and wait for it to dry.
Output:negative
Input:I’m 37 with dry/combo skin. I work long hours & am always on the go. I’ve spent literally hundreds of dollars in pursuit of the best long wearing, non-drying powder foundation & this is my current go to powder & holy grail. 💕<br /><br />It applies effortlessly & provides such amazing coverage! Lasts all day without melting off my face & I love the little sponge applicator that’s included!! Which is really strange, because I usually always toss the sponge that comes with powder foundation & apply with a powder brush. Theirs something magical about the little KVD applicator & I love it!<br /><br />I use the pink Catrice setting spray after applying this powder, just to add a bit of luminosity as it is a matte finish.<br /><br />Can’t say enough good things about this foundation. If you’re on the fence I hope you give it a try & love it as much as I do!<br /><br />Fit Cover active foundation is my second favorite powder foundation. It’s truly fantastic!! It’s also more expensive & I prefer pressed powder vs. loose just for ease of application…I tend to make a mess with loose powders too 😬😂

Input:There is no ""eye cream"" in the little bottle.  The tape works for a couple of hours but not all day before it starts to visibly lift.  I will only use temporarily until my surgery.  I do not recommend long term use, it will exacerbate any problems with your upper eyelids.
Output:negative
Input:These are some fun colors from INH.  They are not for the timid.  I had used an INH semi-permanent color (pink quartz) before and knew what to expect.  This time I tried Wish Bear that is a green blue color. I have curly hair and usually just add color to a few curls around my face, but this time I was feeling crazy and did a full head application. I had mixed results with the different levels of dark and light in my hair.  I would say that the image with the different results based on your starting color are accurate.  If you have a mix of levels in your hair then you will get a mixed  look, too.  This will look best (and get you that prettiest Care Bear color) on a pre bleached platinum level hair.<br /><br />Application is easy if you prep you surfaces (old towels are great) and wear gloves during application. I followed the instructions and had washed the night before so I was applying to dry unconditioned hair. I didn't use a bowl and a brush.  I just used my fingers and was careful to section and saturate. I left it on for an hour because I know from using semi-permanent colors over the last year that I need longer than the usual 30 minutes.  On pastel shades I usually go an hour to two hours.  If you are unsure then do a strand test before you go all over crazy like I did.<br /><br />My hair felt great afterwards.  It is conditioning.  It very much reminds me of the expensive brand that starts with an O.  Would I get this particular color again? For me, probably not. I did not have light enough hair to get the Care Bear look.  I also don't think the green in the blue green works on me. Would I get this brand again? I sure would.

Input:This Brazilian colony is perfect for me for daily work hours. Isn't too strong, its happy, joyful, light, feminine. I always get compliments. My Assistant is very scent sensitive and she always great me saying: today you are wearing your Brazilian perfume, right? And she takes a deep breath of joy. I, myself am very picky with perfumes and I am glad I can find Oopss on Amazon because at Boticario Store in NY they dont  ship to CA (CA restrictions). The company sent It direct from Rio de Janeiro in just few days, I cant believe it was so  fast and well packed. Really happy with my Oopss!

It may the curlers are good for short hair. I tried to use them after I took shower and went to bed. I couldn’t stand it. Next time I tried them for two hours for wet hair but they didn’t work on my hair. They couldn’t curl my hair. My children like to play with them because their colors are amazing.
Output:negative
Input:This exceeded my expectations.  A little heavy if you wear it for 4 hours like I did but I got so many compliments.  Definately would recommend it
Output:positive
Input:I love love love the color....it's very unique: a slightly sheer baby blue with a hint of pink shimmer. However, the formula is horrible! It goes on very streaky and you really have to glob it on thick to look nice, which of course makes drying time extra long. I can't be bothered to use it unless I know I have hours to sit around and wait for it to dry.

Input:I’m 37 with dry/combo skin. I work long hours & am always on the go. I’ve spent literally hundreds of dollars in pursuit of the best long wearing, non-drying powder foundation & this is my current go to powder & holy grail. 💕<br /><br />It applies effortlessly & provides such amazing coverage! Lasts all day without melting off my face & I love the little sponge applicator that’s included!! Which is really strange, because I usually always toss the sponge that comes with powder foundation & apply with a powder brush. Theirs something magical about the little KVD applicator & I love it!<br /><br />I use the pink Catrice setting spray after applying this powder, just to add a bit of luminosity as it is a matte finish.<br /><br />Can’t say enough good things about this foundation. If you’re on the fence I hope you give it a try & love it as much as I do!<br /><br />Fit Cover active foundation is my second favorite powder foundation. It’s truly fantastic!! It’s also more expensive & I prefer pressed powder vs. loose just for ease of application…I tend to make a mess with loose powders too 😬😂

Input:There is no ""eye cream"" in the little bottle.  The tape works for a couple of hours but not all day before it starts to visibly lift.  I will only use temporarily until my surgery.  I do not recommend long term use, it will exacerbate any problems with your upper eyelids.

Input:These are some fun colors from INH.  They are not for the timid.  I had used an INH semi-permanent color (pink quartz) before and knew what to expect.  This time I tried Wish Bear that is a green blue color. I have curly hair and usually just add color to a few curls around my face, but this time I was feeling crazy and did a full head application. I had mixed results with the different levels of dark and light in my hair.  I would say that the image with the different results based on your starting color are accurate.  If you have a mix of levels in your hair then you will get a mixed  look, too.  This will look best (and get you that prettiest Care Bear color) on a pre bleached platinum level hair.<br /><br />Application is easy if you prep you surfaces (old towels are great) and wear gloves during application. I followed the instructions and had washed the night before so I was applying to dry unconditioned hair. I didn't use a bowl and a brush.  I just used my fingers and was careful to section and saturate. I left it on for an hour because I know from using semi-permanent colors over the last year that I need longer than the usual 30 minutes.  On pastel shades I usually go an hour to two hours.  If you are unsure then do a strand test before you go all over crazy like I did.<br /><br />My hair felt great afterwards.  It is conditioning.  It very much reminds me of the expensive brand that starts with an O.  Would I get this particular color again? For me, probably not. I did not have light enough hair to get the Care Bear look.  I also don't think the green in the blue green works on me. Would I get this brand again? I sure would.

Input:This Brazilian colony is perfect for me for daily work hours. Isn't too strong, its happy, joyful, light, feminine. I always get compliments. My Assistant is very scent sensitive and she always great me saying: today you are wearing your Brazilian perfume, right? And she takes a deep breath of joy. I, myself am very picky with perfumes and I am glad I can find Oopss on Amazon because at Boticario Store in NY they dont  ship to CA (CA restrictions). The company sent It direct from Rio de Janeiro in just few days, I cant believe it was so  fast and well packed. Really happy with my Oopss!

Ġanything,ĠWhen,"Input:Terrible<br />Out of 32 years of my life this is the worst hair I’ve ever came across nappy is an understatement anything other hair I’ve purchased lAst 1 month minimum to several<br />Skip right past this u will regret it!
Output:negative
Input:It really helps with odor without smelling like flowers or anything other than natural.  I like this and will buy again for refills.
Output:positive
Input:These are very cute but really don't do anything to help stop slipping.  The 5 stickies barely cover enough area in half of my bathtub.  Very disappointed, don't recommend for safety but I do recommend if you want something cute to decorate
Output:negative
Input:I have just finished my first tube of this awesome product and cant wait for it to arrive again! I recently developed a problem with SLS and had a hard time finding a toothpaste that fit my other criteria, but this one does the trick. It helps my sensitive teeth, foams great but not as much as typical toothpaste which is good because that annoys me :p, no funky after taste, and its not mint or cinnamon. The taste is something new, not bad just new now that ive tried it i cant immagine using anything else like mint ever again. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. My one caveat is that it is fluride free. Due to some health issues i will be needing it for a while but hey its easier for me to add it than to take it out :) so i can deal with that. One other minor issue is that once you use about half the tube it can be hard to get out for people with pretty disabeling arthritis like me. Other than those two things i couldnt be happier!
Output:positive
Input:Never got it but the ones I did get were of good quality.  Just getting anything out of China is difficult.
Output:positive
Input:It didn't do anything. I had an actual ""bronde"" balayage that I just wanted to give a little boost to inbetween colorings, and this didnt do a darn thing. Its just a very mild toner that stripped moisture from my hair. Not worth it at all. Better off getting an actual violet based toner and actually eliminating some brassiness.
Output:negative
Input:It was too expensive for what it was. The tools are Cheap and the eyelashes are nothing special. Also the online classes were so quiet at the top volume so you couldn’t hear anything
Output:negative
Input:I was looking for magnetic eyelashes.  I don’t know if these are good or not because I do. It use anything I need to use glue with.  My bad.
Output:negative
Input:I was so excited and looking forward to getting this electrical brush to help me style my hair in the mornings and save me time when getting ready for work, however it didn’t even turn on, it never heated up, I try different outlets in my house thinking maybe it wotks in another one. But nothing. It’s difficult even to figure out if it’s even on, since there is not even a light indicator to tell you it’s on, there no heat on the brush or anything to be able to figure out the temperature. By far one of the worse products I ever bought.
Output:negative
Input:So I have been using this Emjoi tweezer. And this is my first time using anything like this. It does the job. I started with my under arms. And wow. For me I could see that the hairs were pulled out from the root. Not broken. Caz the little hairs had the root ball and 3/4 longer than I had let grow. But wow. I went slow and in the direction of the growth and it took about 20 minutes to complete both arm pits. If you can handle the pain. This works great.
Output:positive
Input:Not worth buying, if hoping for a nice lingering smell.  I ordered this spray and the Jr Watkins Lavender Body Oil Mist, only because I was a little leery about what would actually have natural lavender in it. What my grievance is, is that Vienna's body mist does not really have a strong smell, in fact it  fades away almost as soon as you spray it.  I tested both sprays on each arm, and my husband said he could not smell anything on the arm that I sprayed with Vienna's.
Output:negative
Input:I absolutely love this color, one coat is transparent and 2 are a beautiful glossy &#34;pink lemonade&#34; color that will match about anything. Orly is a , chip resistant, durable lacquer that offers a very long lasting manicure. I am ordering more of this item at this time.
Output:positive
Input:It didn't do what I expected.  It was a decent facial wash, but didn't do anything to clear any blemishes.
Output:negative
Input:I do love this hair, especially to have ordered off of amazon it was surprisingly good hair! It curls very well and it doesn’t tangle much at all but I’ve only had it in a week now... I didn’t do anything to<br />It I just simply put it in I’m not the type that does all the dying and washing and all that 😂 but I definitely love it... it took me a dat or two to get use to it though and if you don’t like the curl pattern you can easily change it... the only con I have is it does have a little shedding but not to much and I’m getting a lot of compliments on it ❤️
Output:positive
Input:Reportedly, mustard seed oil is hot and spicy. This is not a hot spicy oil. It looks like almond oil or something. Mustard seed oil reduces scarring. My German Shepherd was attacked by two Rottweilers, and sustained serious injuries. The scarring is bad, and I wanted mustard seed oil to reduce scarring. I have no idea what is in this plastic bottle. It could be anything. If you look at the Better Business Bureau's review of this company, Dr. Adorable, they get an F.
